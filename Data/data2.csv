1,"i am a fairly new player and am still trying to wrap my head around dwarven physics. in my current fortress, i have dug a 25-z-level deep pit with a floor made of lead blocks for the purpose of prisoner execution. three trial runs with goblins have failed spectacularly, with all impact damage being “deflected by his &lt;&lt;yak wool glove&gt;&gt;” or other such nonsense. in fact, i’ve yet to cause so much as a sprained ankle with what should be, in my mind, a surefire death drop.

&amp;nbsp;

what am i missing? any help is appreciated.
"
2,"anytime i try to gen a world now, it rejects the world right after it places all the civs. no matter what i do, i never can get a world finalized. any help?"
3,"wait i think i have it. a safe material drop chute, for any distance, or object.

arrange a qsp on the upper dumping floor, or floors, dumping down the chute. at the bottom of the chute, instead of the qsp stockpile, have another minecart sitting on a stop, and dumping into a qsp stockpile. the cart on the floor below is set to dump when anything is placed into it. all of the deadly falling objects will now safely land in the minecart, and then be quietly upended into the stockpile falling 0 z levels and dealing no damage.

&amp;#x200b;

crafters and haulers will take from the lower floor qsp, and will have no reason to stand where the materials are dropped, unless they try to take materials from the minecart in the ticks before it dumps into the qsp.

&amp;#x200b;

i do wonder if crafters will try to take materials from the lower floor cart before it dumps, but set restricted traffic to the cart and the areas around it, and unrestricted traffic on a short hallway that allows dwarves to reach the cart from the side or rear. by the time any dwarf travels that hallway, whatever they wanted will have been dumped.

yes?"
4,"how do you organize pasturing space in your fort?

i recently came up with an idea i found kind of neat - at least, there have been zero incidents with it so far. the idea is as follows: you find a large grassland area somewhere above, channel 4-5 tiles around it for 2-3 tiles deep, build a wall up there for good measure and dig a stairway up to this artificial plateau from inside your fort. this way, you have a large, grassy, sunlit area you can use for all sorts of pasturing and outdoor farming and it's safe from outside hazards.

or is it? i heard some enemies can climb. am i in danger?"
5,"i've been really getting into adventure mode lately and have been trying out a lot of stupid stuff just to see what works. i just loving seeing how the different mechanics interact with each other. what are are your guy's favorite kinds of builds to play or just generally fun play styles?

i'll start off. i call this one ""the homing missile""

step 1: become a necromancer

step 2: start collecting limbs of sapient creatures (they don't have to be sapient but they do have to be able to grasp)

step 3: throw said limbs at some annoyingly fast prey

step 4: resurrect the limbs and watch as they beat your target into submission (bonus points if you use their own limbs)

step 5(optional): give a quick pommel strike and recollect for future use

this one can be pretty useful for any necromancer build as you don't really need any levels in throwing as it's the resurrected limb that does most of the work. alternatively you could just go around carrying entire corpses with you, but somehow that just seems like cheating. "
6,"recently played elephant man for the first time and was amazed to see a horses limb tear off and go flying when i kicked it out of boredom (i'm new to this game). throwing or kicking people to watch them fly 10 meters is fun as well.

do any of you know of any particularly fun things to play as in adventure mode? i know elephant seals and rhino people are close to the stregnth of elephants, and bugs can often be interesting due to the number of limbs you have avaliable."
7,i modded troglodytes to become trainable and domestic pets. something happened and now pretty much a caveman is in charge of my fortress. fun!!
8,"   so i'm not sure what happened, someone elses guess of what happened is the whole world collapsed one level which you will see in the video. i try to show that im not mining adamtine and such. 

   im curious what the possible causes are and if theres any way for me to continue playing this embark. i do play a little hacky, besides the normal shit i do (autodump stone), i accidentially pierced an aquifer in this embark, and tiletyped in a wall. the wall has been there for months or even a year game time so i can't image its that. the only thing that makes sense time wise is legends viewer, and i have no idea how that can cause this, but the night before i was poking around in it. and the next day this happened pretty soon after in terms of game time.

  the really weird shit is the fact the world is revealed and clowns are exposed."

11,"specifically to u/iokwe_aolep for putting out a call for df streamers, and to the community as a whole for being awesome!

i said the other day that i've been considering streaming df for a while, but i'm *hella* rusty and haven't been sure how well it'd go down. seeing interest in it pushed me to stream it today, and i had a fantastic time! i... was not great, but i had a really fun stream, and some really helpful people in chat. definitely something i'll be doing again!

i really didn't just make this post just to shill my channel, but on the off-chance it's something people are interested in, [check me out here](http://twitch.tv/aifendragon). i'll be playing crusader kings ii from about 8am gmt tomorrow (wearing chainmail, because gimmicks) but plan to stream some more dwarf fortress in the afternoon!

mostly, just thanks again for being awesome, and keep being excellent to each other!
"
12,"so, after watching entire steelclutches series by kruggsmash, i recalled this story i read back in 2013 about a group of dwarves who embarked in an area surrounded by 14 necromancer towers. it is my favorite written dwarf fortress story (out of 7 or so i've read in all my years playing df), and so i decided to translate the first chapter of it into english - to create something for dwarf fortress community, to test my skill ~~and to farm some karma~~. and, well, here it is: [\[pdf\]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eytbzzvntb6ktq42e_j3tvrqrzfqmxtl).

so. what do you guys think? do you like it? should i continue? is it even a proper subreddit / website for this kind of content?

edit: link to original story in russian: [\[dfst.ru\]](http://dfst.ru/ru/stories/tag/messianic%20fortification)"
13,"i am once again trying to have fun. my dwarfs are afflicted by a vampire. my attempts to identify the vampire killed the first mayor and nearly killed the best metalsmith. the most recent vampire victim was found drained of blood, and i have one dwarf who was disgusted about watching that dwarf die. i think this means i’ve found the vampire. do vampires get disgusted by killing their victims?"
14,"this is the unwanted and horrible sequel to my facetious post about the dwarves being communist. are the dwarves really subscribed to contemporary ideology? no, it depends on the size of the fort and your playstyle, but it's a fun thought experiment. mayors are usually tame compared to the nobility, none of that hammerer beating the blacksmith crap; there tends to be a very short (sometimes extremely authoritarian) hierarchy. basic goods and services are freely distributed on the basis of need, there is no notion of currency inside fortress, with the obvious exception of caravans."
15,"alright urists, this is just too good not to make into a new thread. so i am playing meph's tileset launcher pack (sort of like masterwork lite) and it's got a few modded materials and decorations...  

my mayor had a mood and made,  
**gethustfikod, harshnessglazed, a large campfire coffer** (26400 dorfbux)  
this is a large campfire coffer. all craftdwarfship is of the highest quality. this object menaces with spikes of purple spinel. on the item is an image of three square cut gems in rhyolite.  

she built gethustfikod *with a clothier's shop*, using rhyolite, purple spinel... and *cave spider silk*.  

yup. moody dorfs can build artifact containers out of **large campfires** by starting with nothing more than spider silk. they must use a lot of silk, too, cause the thing weighs 200г.  

**update omg i just unpaused** the !!large campfire coffer!! is currently burning the loom. oh wow. oh wow. oh great dothrem the louse of spikes, hear my prayer and please let the !!fun!! be survivable. fuck. and we had just captured a live hydra for animal training, too. the whole workshop level is filling with smoke.  

**update #2, several ticks later** the loom and adjacent clothier's shop are fully engulfed. (t)aking a look at the workshop shows that gethustfikod is inside it. it cannot be dumped. i went to an empty pedestal and tried to place the gethustfikod, but it's not showing up in the list of artifacts. i'm going go try removing the workshop. oh fuck oh wow.   

the mayor is annoyed after choking on smoke underground. she feels satisfied after creating an artifact.   

**update #3** the mayor had too much !!fun!! all my leather, cloth, yarn, etc is going up in smoke. i hope the stupid fire burns itself out. welp, i better assign the new mayor to the mayoral quarters before they get pissy.  

oh, and the departing !!xxmayorxx!! knocked us below the population cap. apparently, mûthkat planktree desperately wants to reside here now for the purpose of entertaining citizens and visitors. heh.  

**final edit?** the stockpile fire is out. gethustfikod is still burning at 11000 degrees c. nobody got hurt except for the moody mayor. we lost some
masterwork cloth and some wooden gem bins. the gems themselves seem to be alright. the smoke has a clear vertical path to the surface only 2 z levels above so hopefully it will clear out.  

gethustfikod is still there. i can't q-x remove it and i can't designate it to be dumped. hopefully it's going to be like an adventure mode campfire and naturally go out after a while....  

oh you know what the moody mayor's profession was? a glazer. harshnessglazed. heh.  

**one week later**: i walled gethustfikod up and built a pretty chimney going up higher than any surrounding trees and rooftops. partway through construction, gethustfikod stopped burning. it looks like a stone coffer now that the smoke is gone. the !!xxmayorxx!!'s slab says she ""went missing"" and acknowledged her as the creator of gethustfikod.  

so we're pretty much back to normal. level 2 of the caverns has been breached and draltha is on the menu! lots of webs, fungiwood and spore trees to play with. the replacement mayor turned out to be the og mayor from the previous year. i like him. he's easy. he only mandates production of bolts, and we got those bitches on blast already. might even recommend him for a barony.  

oh, during the fun some blind cave ogres blundered some weapon trap leading up from the caverns. they died spectacularly. so many non-edible body parts to haul. maybe i should build a second atom smasher down in the caverns. "
16,"i'm currently playing adventure mode as a human vampire who lost complete control of his right arm early in his adventure(luckily though he's left handed). i had tried becoming a werebeast in order to heal myself, but ended up getting a vampire curse instead so i'm pretty much stuck with this. what i've been doing so far is just using a steel two-handed sword and getting the best armor i can find for my right arm(idk why). what i want to know is what kinds of debilitating injuries have you guys gotten, and did you have any creative ways of getting around them?"
17,"i was wondering, can you spread necromancy into other civs by making copies of necromancy books and selling them to merchants? mb giving them to travelling scholars?

i want to make world full of necromancers, only necromancers."

19,"greetings. i'm currently on an adventure to max out as many skills as possible on my human adventurer. i'm here to share some tips on training skills.

note: you will be making a lot of macros. head to the wiki page if you don't know how to do this. also, open your init.txt and set macro delay to 1ms.

# combat

**weapon skills:**

&amp;#x200b;

find a relatively large animal. horses, bulls, goats, etc. all work great. use your weapon to stab, slash, or bash it's legs so it moves slowly. then, punch it in the limbs or use a non-lethal weapon to hit it's extremities until you get the message: ""the &lt;name&gt; gives in to pain."". now, use a crush attack on it's eyes to blind it. the animal will not run away or attack, since it cannot see you. it will walk a few tiles sometimes. now, set up a macro to hit it.

&amp;#x200b;

if your weapon is a spear, halberd, pike, or axe, you should use a less-lethal attacking style to hit it. slap with the axe or bash with the spear, halberd or pike. your training dummy is unlikely to die unless you accidentally hit it in the head due to a lack of skill. eventually, it will pass out again due to pain. you can either wait during this time, or train another skill while waiting.

&amp;#x200b;

note: for certain weapons, like whip/scourge and fists, it's possible to find a small animal like a kestrel, rabbit, or raven, and lash then in the neck. for whatever reason, the attack only bruises the skin or simply glances away. this is a fast way to train. needs more science to work out what weapons kill and what don't.

&amp;#x200b;

**unarmed:**

&amp;#x200b;

leveling striker, kicker and biter is similar to weapon skills. note that you can train striker and maybe kicker with the lashing method. for biter, it's the same as weapons, but bite them in the lower body instead of eyes. biting seems to cause relatively little pain.

&amp;#x200b;

**swimmer**:

&amp;#x200b;

find a long, straight river somewhere. these are quite commonly near villages. preferably have a bridge there as well.

swim long distances in the river. if you have at least novice skill level, you shouldn't drown. creatures may sometimes appear in the river. most fish swim away from you. if it's an alligator, crocodile, or other large amphibious animal, may armok have mercy on you. you are likely dead if you don't have armor. this is very unlikely, however. swimming under a bridge will make you drown for a short time. this is actually a good thing- it trains your toughness and endurance stupidly quickly. a macro can be setup for this as well.

&amp;#x200b;

**thrower/archer**

&amp;#x200b;

i'm grouping these skills together, since they are trained in conjunction. set up separate macros to grab stones, flowers, sand, or other small objects and to throw them onto the same tile as you are on. these are very quick skills to train to legendary.

&amp;#x200b;

**wrestler/fighter**

&amp;#x200b;

these skills are stupidly fast to train. simply enter sneaking mode, sneak up to some animal, set your {c}ombat preference to ""close combat"", and ram your face into them. you will grab and release them over and over again. you will become tired quickly, but just rest for a few seconds to regain your stamina. these skills are trained at roughly the same rate, so becoming a legendary wrestler will likely make a legendary fighter as well.

&amp;#x200b;

**ambusher/tracker**

&amp;#x200b;

press k to view tracks, and shift-s + s to enter sneaking mode, then walk over large amounts of land near villages or just in the wilderness. you mustn't fast travel if you wish to gain experience.

&amp;#x200b;

**dodger/armor user/observer**

&amp;#x200b;

you must have a set of armor for this. decent dodger level is recommended.

find a bunch of small animals. ravens, rabbits, buzzards, etc. if it's smaller than 10,000cm³, it's probably fine for training. grab as many as you can before they run away. high ambusher skill is recommended to sneak up to them.

they will attack you relentlessly, but mostly miss of have their attacks deflected by your armor. for whatever reason, you also gain observer experience from this. the more animals you grab, the faster you will gain xp. when you become tired, immediately stop by lying on the ground for a few moments while you regain your stamina. you must do a take-down on the animals, otherwise they will just struggle in vain against your grab, and won't fight. you can set up a macro to wait several times.

&amp;#x200b;

**shield user**

&amp;#x200b;

you must own a shield for this. do the same as above, but with only 1 animal. set up a macro to block the animal's attack constantly, then wait after. do this till' legendary.

&amp;#x200b;

**knapper**

&amp;#x200b;

set up macros for picking up stones, and removing them from your bag. then set up yet another macro for sharpening the stones. this is a quick skill, but obnoxious to train without macros. seems to improve focus and analytical ability attributes as well.

&amp;#x200b;

**persuader**

&amp;#x200b;

find someone to talk to. use the conversation menu to state your values, then find something they agree with you on.

create a macro to say that to them over and over again. repeat. trains linguistic ability, albeit slowly.

&amp;#x200b;

other skill training is still under studies. some skills seem nearly impossible to train at any decent speed such as climber, social/conversationalistic skills, butcher, carpenter, etc.

thanks for reading"

27 dwarves and who knows how many zombies later, the four-horned web-slinging crystal glass kusunsodor ngospazongosp, known to the caverns as reigndeep, the prime throne, was finally dead.

tried to look at crystal glass raws to figure out why it was so hard to kill it but i can't make sense of the numbers. any idea why masterwork silver hammers would simply chip at it instead of instawrecking a whole limb?"

27,"hey folks, i've actually never started a game of df, but have watched a few friends play, and spectated the community from afar, so please forgive me if this topic is done to death.  
  
i'm wondering about the histories that arise in your playthroughs, if they ever present you with psychologically relevant synchronicities. it even seems like dwarf fortress could be a very useful method of divination. do the histories of your dwarfs ever coincide or compensate for events in your life?"
28,"as someone who plays dwarf fortress religiously, and has been for around a year and a half, i’ve taken to absolutely love adventure mode; possibly even more than fortress mode.

with the new villains update coming, i’ve seen a huge improvement in the game so far and it will surely benefit both fortress mode and adventure mode to implement villains into the game. at some point, cities will become more fleshed out than they are now, and as someone who enjoys slaying beasts and fighting bandits with even odds, i can say that i enjoy building a character up from a literal nobody into a folk legend. with this in mind, i thought about some other ways an adventurer could make a name for himself:

city arenas - an arena in town where townsfolk, wandering travellers, or existing champions participate in gladiatorial combat to earn the title of champion. thinking back to legends mode, i see a lot of “historical figures”: warlords that have slain thousands of men on the battlefield. wouldn’t it be interesting to see how your adventurer fares against an acclaimed warrior? my interpretation would be that your adventurer would start off fighting other peasants who want to make a name for themselves in the arena, and slowly gain more fame as more battles have been won (and maybe be rewarded with some prize money, too). when many battles have been won in one certain arena, champions from other towns or cities would travel to battle you, either lethally or non-lethally (training swords could be used in non-lethal combat, with “lightly tapping the target” being used as a points system, sort of like in fencing), and lethal combat could be either to the death or until one of the participants yield. 

while winning fights grants you fame, losing a fight shouldn’t decrease your fame (provided you’re still alive), unless a fight was lost against a peasant or a simple bandit. in doing so, i believe cities could be more expansive and would give an adventurer somewhere to fight without having to risk life and limb venturing to an ettin’s lair. 


player titles

until now, titles have been given when a creature manages to amass a somewhat impressive number of kills. the titles given are randomly generated, which makes them very... dwarfy. i feel like they could follow a more specific set of rules, such as the majority of kills you have being forgotten beasts, undead, etc. an adventurer could also choose their own title, but won’t be named as such unless they are known for their actions. 

perhaps, if an adventurer performs enough good deeds for the ruler of the city, they could be knighted, and receive a set of masterwork armour, the metal of which dependant on what civilisation you’ve been knighted in; dwarven = steel, humans = iron / gold (maybe?) and elven = grown wood (stupid treefondlers). 


duels 

as it stands, an argument between an adventurer and another sapient being does not lead to much in the way of resolution. however, if a conversation should upset a person enough, then they may challenge the adventurer to a duel (or vice versa). a duel must always take place outside, be lethal, and be performed with melee weapons. a duel could be used, i reckon, in a number of ways:

- as a more violent solution to a verbal conflict

- a way to prove your worth to more experienced warriors who refuse to travel with you (no more, “it is i that would lead you, but i have no need of your protection)

- if a crime syndicate has been mostly dismantled, a villain mostly foiled, etc, due to the player’s actions, then the villain / criminal overlord could enter a town and challenge you to a duel. 

- a way to start a fight with a bandit leader without the easy slaughter of his comrades. 

i feel as though this would bring an end to the sullying of reputation in towns, how starting any sort of fight now automatically renders you a ‘bad person’. additionally, to be perfectly candid, i feel as though being labelled a ‘killer’ for killing bandits isn’t necessary, and should most certainly not warrant everyone calling you as such. 


“want to know how i got these scars?”

this is somewhat tertiary, but whenever i play as an adventurer, he always sustains some sort of debilitating injury. my favourite story to tell is of my jaguar man, takuth nashonsoshosh (bloodyjackal) who became a fabled warrior through countless endeavours with bandits, goblins and beasts. he left his hamlet a peasant, and returned a victor. i won’t go into too much detail, but he was known across the continent for his bravery and martial prowess. however, after facing a dragon, his left eye was gouged out by its claws, leaving a vertical scar down his face. “fair enough.”, i thought, as he took down the dragon with a hearty swing at its head with his golden sword, an artefact by the name of asteshlim (cudgelwisp).

after killing the dragon and eating her liver for lunch, takuth ventured into a dark fortress, where he met a goblin warlord. blocking most of the blows with his shield, takuth saw an opening to stab the warlord’s chest. after a dodge from the warlord, takuth was open to attack, and with a swing from the goblin’s battle-axe, takuth’s left hand, the one wielding the shield that saved his life many times, had sailed off in an arc. pale from blood loss, i thought it was over. i never save scum because it makes for some interesting stories. i thought it was over, until takuth’s jaguar teeth found their way into the goblin’s neck. open to attack, the goblin managed to hack off takuth’s right leg, causing him to fall to the ground. after a few parries and shaking of the goblin’s neck, takuth ripped the goblin’s head off with his teeth. i always carry a crutch in case this happens, preferably iron or steel, and equipped it. takuth strapped the goblin’s head to his lower body (i imagined him wearing it on his belt), and managed to get back to the tavern i had him staying in (for free, due to the good deeds he’d done, which also came with free drinks). after i got back, i made takuth rest for at least a week, drinking and eating accordingly. i made him write a book detailing the journey, or mostly the ‘slaying of (goblin name)’. i retired him soon after as i wanted him to live in the tavern in peace. 

excuse the tangent. 

anyways, my point was that should you have an injury that alters your appearance, say a facial scar or a missing finger, or even hand, it could become a topic in conversation. it could reward you with fame for telling people that you had your eye gouged out slaying a dragon, granting you extra fame for ‘living to tell the tale’.


property and pets

after performing a few tasks for the ruler of a city, an adventurer should be able to buy or be rewarded a piece of property. in a player owned house, one can store their belongings, artefacts and weapons, without fear of being stolen. 

in addition, one may buy a horse, dog or other animal to accompany them. with the riding mechanic that has been previously talked about by toady, one should be able to purchase a horse after this has been implemented. alternatively, if a dog is bought it could join you on adventures, whether it be hunting or beast slaying. naming options could also be added, but the primary function is for companionship (and also getting rid of those annoying bogeymen).


anyway, i just thought i’d share some things i think i’d like to see added in the (likely not so near) future. let me know if you’d add anything else, and if you think my ideas could be improved. 

thanks :)"
29,"'how long has it been since the age of myths ended?

the battle of splattering assaults seemed as promising as it looked. but remember the other time we tried to invade the dark fortress ulnoarstruk? when we thought the fabled final battle were in our hands???

the day the demon imi deadcat gets unleashed into this world. fiereballs that incinerated our militia commander. those are armies that survived the goblin horde that destroyed fortresses of our twin civilisation, the ring of trade.

the battle that is supposed to end the vile force of darkness, turned out to end us. the demon tainted the dead to his own image. the darkfiends have a tainted miasma that turns dwarf insane over time of exposure. the best axe lords, falling to the cursed sight of corpses, sucuumbing from tantrums to insanity. when was the time where dwarven child could play hide and seek amongst goblin corpses without worries? none would believe such tales from the age of myths. soon it will just be travellers' tales, and the fortress of ebalkdol shall be left to the care of great armok.'"
30,"i got a reply from stephen burke from gn.

&gt;i know of dwarf fortress but have never played it. is there any built-in  or community-made benchmark? how would you propose testing it? we have  no familiarity with the game, so that makes it difficult to add to  testing. 

can we as the df community come up with a good benchmark that can pit cpus against each other in the game?

i know that many of us would like to see how the newest epyc 64-core would perform given its cache sizes.

&amp;#x200b;"
31,"so i have wanted to get into dwarf fortress for a while not and i finally have, i started last weekend.  my first fort has has been going surprisingly well, or at least up until the part i'm about to tell you.  for three years my fort went fine and dandy, i thought i was going to die first winter but got lucky, and my area is in a hot climate so winter means literally nothing in this area.  for 3 years i didn't see a single enemy, i was surprised, no goblins, no sieges, i just got really lucky on my first fort.  i was honestly having a lot of fun, expecting to die real soon, by this point i've been board not knowing what to do having thought i would already be dead i didn't have any long term goals.  the only issue we had was some gray languars early on that stole our only copper axe and one of two copper picks.  shortly after caravan came but i had no clue how to work the trading system and didn't really have anything to trade as i had yet to find any ore.  we quickly overcame that once we finally struck ore, my one pick is being used be my now legendary +5 miner, and quickly began forging a boat load of them.  after a while a giantess and we promptly slaughtered it, by this point is when we were at around 140 dwarves.  problems began at the end of the third year, a human turned up, first human we have seen.  he was a were-llama.  i had recently set up 3 military squads with iron armour and weapons, but none of them were trained.  it took a bit but we killed the were-llama.  at this point i didn't know a dwarf could be infected.  i got lucky first round, after about a month a single dwarf turns and goes on a killing spree.  after slaying our brother and checking the extremely long list of combat logs, we lost about 50 dwarves by this point to the two were-llamas, previously only having 3 dead, all due to suicide, i discovered we had 6 possible infected dwarves and began construction on a containment chamber but we only had about 10 days to do it.  it was to late, 25 of granite, 4th year of the fortress, all 6 turn, and there was a massacre, a hasty burrow is made and alerted in one of the under construction rooms a level below.  all 6 llamas died but so many things happened the combat logs were wiped and i couldn't find out how many might be infected.  down to roughly 60 dwarves, it turns out only 2 got infected but the military is gone, the elven caravan just showed up, and mid battle some migrants show up, i'm now at 85 dwarves and waiting to see if any more turn, and if this fortress is even worth saving.

&amp;#x200b;

none the less i am proud of my first fort, and for being a first fort i learned a hell of a lot, and am ready to take on some more."
32,"i really like watching df streams, so if you know one or are one, please post his/your twitch/youtube user page, thanks. :)

edit: thanks for the replies! feel free to still recommend me more streamers, the more, the better."
33,"i have been a fan of df now for around 5-6 years and i often have spouts of returning, often with an update or a while since my last play. its the one game i come back to again and again because of its emergent nature. there are always a few issues that kill my vibe and desire to play, one of the big ones, and a classic one i assume for people is design and goals. when ever i start, i always look at the world and then think ""okay what do i do?"", i know how to play the game pretty well at this point, so learning isn't an issue but when it comes to fortress design, i have no clue.

&amp;#x200b;

i often have phases of design, whether its entirely spontaneous (sometimes a complete mess, sometimes i try something symmetrical or half planned and often fail) or i sit for 10, 20 or even 40 minutes at a time and pre-designate my fortress (and then proceed to just turn the game off because i have had my fill and in the end i always overlook something and it bugs me). what to do and how is always my big issue, i always have the urge to have an end goal so just embarking and digging a dining hall, some rooms and industry always feels rough and un-natural despite the fact that i would like it, when ever i do design something complex it is never as good as i want it to be and then turns me off playing, its a lose lose situation. 

&amp;#x200b;

does anyone else have this issue? i really want to just make a world, pick a site and then play, make something really fun and have some interesting experiences but now, not only do i know the game really well so the only difficulty is the harsh self imposed limits or gimmicks, but getting over that initial hump of an un-striked earth and 7 dwarves sitting on the surface with nothing to do. if anyone has experienced this or has some really interesting designs/forts/concepts then please share, you would be saving me.

&amp;#x200b;

also, if anyone has any mid to high level play guides/lets-plays or anything then link them, i always want to read/watch them but the only ones i ever find are the painfully slow low level guides or lets-plays that always begin on how to dig a 3x3 room into a mountain. "
34,"hey dwarfs!

i'm the guy who started a few months ago a let'splay series called mooncanyon, focused on storytelling and with a lot of production value, which, as you may know, is all narrated in spanish.

i'm here just to let you all know that the series has now english subtitles!
i've been hiring a translator since episode 2 and i plan to continue doing the same until the end, and see how it goes.

35,"i sent my dwarves to go pillage some elf village. thinking they would go down and around the long way from my fort since they are on the same continent, when they returned the report showed that they took it upon themselves to swim across the ocean to get there... anyone else seen something like this?

https://i.redd.it/mvzut393dy121.png"
36,"(entirely default df, with only a few changes to the controls because i'm new)

adventure mode: the quiet shell, a land of savagery and filth.

**s**o in the last post i told you the story of how entante and morocanth (spider guy and a forgotten lobster with wings and fire breath). now here's about a season later

&amp;#x200b;

   **l**ate fall-ish. entante, now riding on the back of his pure luck tame (their still somewhat at odds but at least morocanth doesn't try to kill him) is able to make much longer journeys now that there's something keeping the bogeymen at bay.(the entire town he was in rejected going with him for blood and glory)

&amp;#x200b;

   **t**his time he treads into a small goblin refuge, which, unsurprisingly, lacked a military force of any kind. that of course, did not stop them from taking a giant fucking lobster that has wings and breathes fire as a threat, and immediately began mustering up what little combat force they had to try and kill it. lucky for me i spent a lot of time learning how to dodge and draw attention, because entante ended up becoming the center of attention while morocanth roasted everything else that moved. about 3 trolls, a beakdog, and 5 goblins later the whole place was ripped asunder from the sheer force of a crazy silk spinning, bob and weaving (get it?), axe swinging, mf pseudo dragon riding piece of shit and his eyeless, hairless, winged, many legged, flame-throwing lobster thats apparently a cannibal. entante spared every other type of sentient being unless they put up a fight, to which they were swallowed. he got a few scars and burns (got too close to a house) but got off without much trouble. morocanth went unscathed, as i guessed i couldn't heal him if i wanted to, so i had him play the role of artillery. another 5 in game hours pass before every goblin in the village is found, killed, butchered, and fed to the almighty morocanth. apparently forgotten beasts don't get phased by ghosts, and i managed to abuse that by using an elf as their scapegoat.

&amp;#x200b;

   **l**ooking at the loot i took every artifact and wound up with another axe (skyrim reference? sure i'll dual wield), a cool chestplate which i assume doesn't really help my combat, and a little book of life and death. i don't know where the hell these goblins got that from, but the blown up building half a day west looks like where it used to be. entante has yet to read the book. 

&amp;#x200b;

  **i** dont know where i'm going, but blood seems to follow now that my lobster got a good taste of it. that goblin city looks tasty, might just wipe out their smaller settlements. **army of 1 and a dragon wannabe!!!**"
37,"mine happened in the 3rd year with a pop around 30 (i think) when a weremonitor lizard came and attacked my fisherman.

i sent my hastily assembled, untrained, and unequipped squad to kill the thing and they eventually succeeded.  many were wounded but i seemed to recover until everyone wounded in the attack turns into a werelizard and attacked everyone in my fort.  the monsters were eventually killed but all my dwarves were wounded.  the smooth stone halls were coated with blood.  my last dwarf to die lay in the entrance hall, completely mad, and unable to move on account of his 2 broken legs.  he eventually died of dehydration"

[battle of roaddoctrines year 130, 200+ elves vs. 40 dwarves](https://i.redd.it/fhp54nobfr121.png)

the world i generated had a crap ton of elves. as in 30 thousand elves on this continent. it's year 5 here and the mountainhome is my fortress after striking it rich with adamantine. however, negotiations with the treehugging bastards go sour after i forget to remove a designation. obviously, the elves are pissed. within a month they take down one of the neighboring fortresses, replacing the population with pointy eared fucks. naturally under the kings banner we raid, pillage, and raze the fortress to prevent it to falling ever again into elven hands. they don't like the slaughter of 500 elves, so the invasion occurred dead of the night. beak dogs who we stole from a dark fortress gave us the first alarm, going down gloriously while taking down the smaller warbeasts. first alert dwarves astesh fell valiantly after taking down 5 elves (though for some reason he fell asleep mid-battle idk why). the rest of the army came up and killed the hippies, but not before we lost 2 dwarven axelords (astesh being one of them) and 40 beakdogs. surprisingly the slaughter numbed everyone in the fort to death, and the corpse stockpiles nearly overflowed with bodies. it could've been a last stand scenario, but steel and adamantine axes coupled with an artifact platinum mace heavily turned the tide in our favor. can i commit elven genocide with the raze function to return the favor?"

41,"i keep reclaiming ruins on embark, specifically ones that were abandoned because of a dragon or roc or forgotten beast, who then settled there. (i check the legends before choosing a site.) the first couple times, i explored timidly, fearful at every moment that my scout would be eviscerated/broiled/dissolved by the ancient beast lurking around the next corner. but...i've never seen a single one of these beasts. has anyone actually encountered the ruin-making monster in a reclaim embark?"

but late-game, man, isn't it worth it to have an army of giant tigers? you can't trade for exotic animals anywhere else, can you?

i've never had an issue with the elves, as i grow trees underground to harvest, and make things out of stone because it's so plentiful.

so is this elf hatred thing just a meme? please educate me"
44,"as it says, i just had my first dragon encounter. this is how it went.

&amp;#x200b;

the one thing that really sticks out in my mind is just that... honestly. i wish i hadn't been caught so off guard.

i was building a small water pump station to have access to clean water, when boom, dragon attack. i would have gladly caught the beast for gladiatorial bouts in my grand dining hall/tavern/colosseum, but she showed up at such an awkward time. i tried my best to get the gate shut to funnel it down my *""guest entrance""* which is full of traps of all sorts, from cage traps to the ol' two raising bridges on either end set up ^(yeah... that wouldn't have worked as i would soon learn), but she was upon me far too fast. lost a woodworker, nauseated by the sun who couldn't get inside fast enough.

at this point, i realized something ghastly. this was indeed my first dragon encounter, but i have had run-ins with fire breathing monsters before. once, a firebreathing horse attacked one of my previous forts. it was one of my earliest fortresses so it was quite the challenge, but this memory had given me a false impression of firebreathers. the horse used a very similar attack pattern to magma crabs, which spew molten stone out in these very compact, flaming projectiles. this is what the horse did as well. this is what i expected from the dragon as well.

the look on my face when the dragon breathed flame for the first time. the screen was enveloped by smoke and flames. the forest surrounding my fortress was set ablaze immediately and i realized how badly i had underestimated this thing. i prayed for someone to pull the lever to my raising bridge posthaste. they did. bridge came up.

my... *wooden bridge.*

the courtyard was enveloped in flame and smoke as the dragon burst through the oh so flimsy structure that i in my foolishness had thought indestructable. the guards in the courtyard were immediately tied in combat and i feared the worst. this is however where i have to mention something about this fortress.

my current fortress has had a very steady stream of mercenaries join us over the years. moreso than any other fortress i've ever had, i believe. it is the 7th year of the fortress and my military is 40 dwarves and 20 mixed mercenaries strong. the grand barracks area is connected to the spiraling ramp that leads into the fortress proper, giving the warriors ample time to rush out to deal with any problems like this.

at my command the squads surged out, one of my many axe lords at their head, they charged out into the flaming courtyard where the three guards who were on duty had unfortunately fallen. but not for naught, as they had done their duty to keep the monster outside.

this is where i wish i could write about some epic battle where many dwarves fought valiantly to protect their home, but unfortunately, or fortunately if i have to look at the situation in terms of losses we got away with no casualties beyond the three guards and the woodworker who was caught in the initial attack.

the axe lord leading the pack made short work of the dragon, going to town on its belly and legs, taking shelter behind her shield. she very quickly hacked the dragon in the neck and ended the beast then and there. very simple. anticlicmatic even. thus ended my first dragon encounter.

&amp;#x200b;

aftermath:

i'm... kind of bummed out. i really wanted that thing alive. i did the next best thing and placed the dragons corpse on a pedestal in the entry hall, to impress and terrify guests to the fortress. i do not know if seeing this monsters carcass on a daily basis in such a  busy intersection is going to cause mental scarring in the dwarves, but i am certainly willing to live with that for such an impressive trophy.

i am now considering a new drawbridge. it will have to be made of dolomite to ensure no more unfortunate incidents. (edit: never mind, dolomite can't stand the heat either. gotta build a moat.) but after seeing the raw destructive power of dragonfire, i am very much excited by the possibilities."
45,"i  had just made it to the summer of year 3 when i got attacked by a werelizard who (unbeknownst to me) infected 3 of my dwarves.  i didn't understand the mechanics, so i just let them hang around in my hospital.

those 3 went on to kill 3 more and infect a further 5 before they could be killed.  there were about 10 injured in total, but i had no way of separating the infected from the uninfected, so i was just going to count them all a loss and wall up the hospital.

before i could even do that, a goblin siege of 5 showed up...  i didn't realize how unprepared i was militarily.  all i had was 2 squads setup of farmers and fish dissectors mostly.  i also didn't realize that my dwarves didn't carry weapons generally unless told to.

my war dogs and squads took out 3 of the goblins before being almost entirely wiped out.  it took me a while to realize that non military dwarves just run away while being killed and they don't defend themselves.

by time i reassigned the squads and killed the other 2 goblins, i went from about 80 dwarves to 18, most of them badly injured and so depressed they were losing their sanity.

what i learned:

you need weapons and armor.

build a moat or wall.

make a choke point. my fortress was just an undefended staircase down into the ground.

traps?


even though i was pissed, it was a good learning experience.

any other tips?"
46,"just downloaded df today and wow is it complex.  i tried adventure mode and while i had no idea what to do half the time, it was fun af. 


everything being represented by symbols and the amount of hotkeys was painful but got used to it after a while.  


i followed the quickstart guide and spawned as human in a mead hall.  after fumbling around with the conversation system i recruited the two nearest people, a spearman and an axewoman and asked around for a quest.  


i chose the bandit camp option and headed south for it.  after nearly dying of thirst before figuring out how to melt ice and snow, we heard random screams of help and found a lone pikeman running away.  after tracking him for a few minutes one of my companions manages to intercept him and took out his leg, then both companions brutally mauled him to death while he was on the ground for some reason.  got a sweet silver pike out of it (and some traumatization according to the character description lmao) but yikes i just wanted to see what was up with him running.  


freshly armed and armored i became drowsy and slept and was attacked by a cougar, which was easily mauled by my squad.  i kept the corpses of both the pikeman and the cougar cause i thought you can cook them or something but that didn’t work.


after eating my starting flounders i arrived at the bandit camp hungry and found it occupied by a warhammer dude, a crossbowman, and two pikeman.  none were aggressive which was weird but i cheap shotted them from behind anyway and most yielded from the first few blows, but i wanted their stuff so nope.


full of bags and loot i travelled to the nearest town, but when i arrived my speed was .1 and could barely move so i looked around for food.  i found a raven near a river and snuck up to it, but it flew across after i struck it and i drowned trying to reach it.   


can’t wait to start a fresh game tomorrow, what an experience."
47,"i had an a very interesting run in adventure mode full of murder, thievery and warmongering. i was a goblin swordsman who hated his own kind and vowed to destroy all goblin civilization at any cost. i started by killing some beast including a vampire lord. i eventually got a group large enough to wipe out a necromancer tower and steal the artifact. i then went to the largest goblin fortress and killed as many goblins as i could (but i didnt find the demon running the place) and left with a mangled toe. i then settled in my hamlet after making my civilization go to war with the goblins, forever changing the political state of my world."

with a world crumbling to an end at his feet, beor fellhammer, first and last dwarven god of the second pantheon, cradles in his palm his cherished homeland.

reaching into the void, he brings dwarves from the time of their deaths to him, in order to build a better future.

#####the beginning#####

dwarves from all realms and times have found themselves waking up in a small, rudimentary chapel, dedicated to beor. this chapel is, in turn, found within a larger fortress; rakust dosîm.

the world outside has been changed drastically. surrounding the fortress; a gigantic chasm pockmarked with caves, with a magma ocean stretching as far as the eye can see.

dwarves have settled into their new surroundings, building rooms, workshops and chambers to suit their needs. as the population grows and more questions arise, only time will tell what will be revealed.

#role-playing#

on this server, you will be playing a character. for this world, specifically, you will be playing a dwarf who has been displaced from their home (whether they remember that or not, is up to you). 

think of a backstory, which can be as detailed as you want. where does your dwarf come from? what are their interests? how do they talk and act? are they brave or cowardly? all these little nuances will add up to create a truly memorable character.

you can be any profession you wish, from mechanically-based ones such as blacksmiths, farmers and alchemists, to more roleplay-based ones, such as scholars, explorers, cheesemakers, and many more. our team of storytellers and community moderators will do their best to allow each player to form their own stories and make their own experiences.

52,"hi. we all have silly dwarfs who vomits all around the place.

elves, humans, goblins and dwarfs they all can vomits, but hey they are just fantasy creatures and they are okay to do that.

but in reality some animals can not vomit.

like horses.

does anyone of you ever seen horse to vomit in game?

i saw monkey, various animals... but never noticed horse.

so is there anyway i can test it?

or toady know it that horses are not able to vomit so he didn't programmed it? actually he did but without that function()

&amp;#x200b;

edit:

&amp;#x200b;

i just remember that we have arena. i put one horse and 10 humans with dwarfs, no weapons, all died. horse survived. what the hell

&amp;#x200b;

still no vomiting."
53,"""ohhhhhhhh shit an ettin, what the hell is an ettin oh crap wiki says semi-megabeast building destroyer requiring dual decapitation...i guess this is the !!fun!! everyone has been talking about, don't pant, don't panic, losing is fun right"" \*orders all levers pulled *now*\* **marksdwarves to your stations this is not a drill i repeat this is -**

wait...he...wtf, he got caught in my *maple wood cage trap?*""

that was my very, very disappointing first experience with cage traps. since then i have only come to despise them more and more as they seem to really ruin the immersion and challenge of enemies. when i recently looked up that an ettin was *one hundred and thirty-three times the size of a dwarf*, and that cage traps could catch even larger creatures like dragons and rocs, i got super pissed and then eventually calmed down when i saw toady acknowledge that cage traps would eventually have to change in multiple ways.

my dream realism solution is that toady allows several trap sizes to be built -- small, medium, large, very large, with increasing production requirements -- and places a timer based on the size of the creature in relation to the material and size of the built cage. i.e., a goblin caught in a medium \*steel cage\* trap can never escape (not large enough for timer to trigger), but an ettin caught in the same trap could only be confined for an in-game day. catching and holding semimegabeasts and above would require very large cages made of steel or better, and megabeasts could only be contained by superexpensive means (divine + adamantine endgame alloy?).

that would result in the original reaction i had to an ettin -- mild, scurrying panic. imagine an ettin showing up in year 3, running through and ruining all your small, medium, and large traps one after the other, and then being able to jump over walls of less than 3z due to the ettin's massive size. all the sudden, having a caged ettin would be much more remarkable -- having a caged dragon would grant the ultimate df bragging right.

until that happens, i'm determined to either not use cage traps anymore or to change them. can anyone tell me if the game can be modified so that cage traps only catch creatures up to a certain size? alternatively, i'm not sure if trapavoid can be added to creature raws, but i would consider doing that too.

other ideas of how traps could be currently used and how they might be usefully used in the future are welcome, would love to have a discussion on it."

56,"hello all,

&amp;#x200b;

on the 8th - 9th december i will game for 24 hours for charity (multiple schlerosis - three people close me to suffer from  it). i will be playing dwarf fortress for most of it. i am looking to generate a large world in which i can start all my forts during the session as they will all surely perish in horrible fun ways. eventually i want to then start to reclaim the earlier forts. i want to generate a world which has the following:

* all races still alive in the world
* lots of dwarves still alive
* at least one biome of evil (i think there is always one?)

so what are the best options to choose during world generation as i am no way an expert at df. or better, does someone have a save that fulfils the above requirements perhaps even a used save game with a site that can be reclaimed during my gaming session.

my playing style will be to hard-limit the number of dwarves that can be in the fort to the number of people who donated and want a dwarf named after them. this means game play will be relatively slow but this way i can focus more on the story aspects.

i am under no illusion that i will have a constant stream of viewers but hey, ""fake it till you make it"" eh and i want to put the effort for the effort in for all the generous people who donated to my cause.

then some questions:

* does having a larger world impact fps of your current running fort (as opposed to only loading time at the start).
* does anyone have any experience with a 24 hour gaming session and want to offer any tips if so?

and finally, i'm gonna do some cheeky advertising here for my charity: if anyone wants to help fund research for the fight against ms you can donate to my event here and have a dwarf named after you (leave comment with donation if so - site is in dutch only unfortunately): [https://www.sterktegenms.nl/actie/gamen-tegen-ms](https://www.sterktegenms.nl/actie/gamen-tegen-ms)"
57,"i spent a good chunk of my first year building a massive wall with fortifications around the front of a box canyon. mined out all of the ramps and started a wall to keep anything from shooting down from the top into the canyon. basically, i had the makings of a standard underground fortress with a nice fenced-in front yard.

the thing about rocs is that they can fly and they don't give a fuck about walls. or *plans.*

the military consisted of two month-old squads, still short on equipment. most civilians had an obsidian short sword, but against a flying monster with an infinite number of emotions that are all bloodlust they all provided little resistance.

a silver hammer lay *somewhere* in the fortress, designated to be melted. standard quality. not much galena on the map and i didn't want to waste it, and i'd only just begin outfitting soldiers. i found the dwarf closest to it and assigned him to a new squad with said silver hammer as his weapon.

the marksdwarves bought him enough time to run into the ""yard"" and get a few good smashes to the back of the roc. this immobilized the beast enough to let the surviving, maimed civilians pile on and eventually kill the thing.

the dwarf who charged the roc with a silver hammer also died on account of not having a head after the pile-up.

about all that's left is a dozen adult dwarves and twenty to thirty children. something like forty dwarves ended up dying since they were all, you know, working on the fucking wall when it showed up.

just a nice reminder that this game will always find a way to surprise you when you think you have it all under control. i'm going to power through it. after all, i have *dozens* of free bedrooms now.

and that is all i have to say on the subject of getting roc'd."
58,"hi, 

&amp;#x200b;

i am currently playing a somewhat difficult old fort of mine which i wanted to reclaim.

problem with the reclamation is that there are clowns loose in the fort.

&amp;#x200b;

so after a few attempts i survived sealing up the old fort and digging a sidefort. then i started preparing for expeditions. oh and engraving slabs.... oh so many slabs...

a few dead military squads and 3 vampires thrown at clowns later it wasn't looking like i would make any headway anytime soon.

but then: a vile force of darkness has arrived. great... with a little over 30 dwarves i had no choice but to seal myself in my new sidefort.

but then i thought. do goblins play nice with hfs? so i sacrificed a miner and opened up the sealed fort to the siege.

turns out it takes 2-3 clowns to break a goblin siege\^\^

i had to picture the goblin army arriving at the abanonded eery fort. stuff lying everywhere, no sound to be heard.

they advance., especially the dumb trolls wanting to smash some left over stuff. 

then they enter a room and experience horror. 

&amp;#x200b;

i have now the second round of ""guests"" to my fort and more and more of my old fort opened up to me. maybe with the 3rd or 4th siege i could finally reach the magma smelters. 

&amp;#x200b;

so remember dont be so quick to kill goblins... they do have uses\^\^"
59,"is there a way to build a hillcock in fortress mode? 

the idea is to embark on a flat land, build a hill, and then tunnel a fortress into the hill, so that i can admire the outside at the same time as i look at the inside of my fortress.

i am not against using toots such as dfhack or anything. "
60,"the tavern is one of the best, and least utilized, defenses available in the game. not only will a good tavern (sans barkeep) be a massive mood boost to native dwarves (thereby preventing tantrum spirals), but making them your primary entrance can prove a vital early defense. here are a few of my top reasons for making them the first place you dig...

1. three of the first things your fortress will need are storerooms, dining tables and a place to sleep (you could argue food and drink, but foraging can handle both). taverns can provide all three: a cellar beneath for secure storage, the main tavern for dining, and a dormitory above to provide a safe place to sleep.
2. as mentioned, taverns are a massive source of happy thoughts (so long as you don't serve alcohol, which leads to brawls and death), keeping those nasty tantrum spirals far away. this comes not only from the glory of the hall itself inspiring the dwarves, but also from the recreation value idle dwarves gain from having entertainment rather than merely waiting in place.
3. taverns are going to be one of the busiest spots in any fortress, which ensures that any sneaky thieves will have to get past a great many watchful (or, more likely, drunken) eyes before they can reach anything of value you might really miss.
4. one of the first visitors you will likely receive are mercenaries. while at first glance they might seem like useless freeloaders eating up what little food and ale you have, they are fully armed and trained warriors who will remain stationed at the tavern. by making the tavern your primary entrance, you ensure any hostile forces will have to fight their way in without needing to risk any dwarven blood. throw your trade depot into the tavern hall (near the cellar doors for ease of hauling), and you can add caravan guards to for entrance defenses.
5. taverns can provide a massive population boost of useful and interesting visitors who provide value to your fortress, such as the aforementioned mercenaries, monster hunters and beast hunters who actively seek out dangerous enemies, performers too keep your dwarves entertained, and scholars who might bring or even write interesting works (just be careful they don't steal yours!).

also, post is up for sharing your own defensive tactics. please feel free to share!

62,"i wanted to compile some of the best designs and tactics the community has to offer. please feel free to post some of your favorites, be they what you've built, seen, or even just thought about."
63,"how do you guys plan the z levels of your fort, especially factoring magma forges? do u have ur smiths walk 100+ z levels to go down and up, or is ur entire fort really below the earth? give me ur thoughts"
64,"one aspect of my designs is a tendency to build bedrooms near the owner's workshop, and to place a second bed within the room for any partner (current or future). however, this creates complication due to marriages between different trades. having my blacksmith married to my carpenter, or (worse) one of my farmers means a long walk of shame back to work, or greatly increased estrangement. i know that dwarf fortress does have a shared bed system like rimworld (yet), making this mostly a flavor issue which only really affects those as ocd as me, but nonetheless i have resorted to resolving the issue by going full spartan, where women run the state and all men serve in the military. this has proven to have a number of benefits...

&amp;#x200b;

1. simplified bedding - obviously, the first benefit i will cover is the aforementioned bedding. men will automatically gain access to the communal barracks, and will marry out into general population as time goes on (supposing their wife is important enough to have her own chambers). this insures everyone can live near their workshop while spreading defensive troops throughout the fortress during off duty hours, and keeps the husbands of important figures out of demeaning quarters.

&amp;#x200b;

2.  defense - besides troop dispersal, having half of your population automatically in the military guarantees a strong defensive force right from the start. while you may not always get the best fit, you will always have numbers. add in that it improves civilian armament through work tools being shared among a smaller pool of dwarves and civilian survivability cannot help but improve, although this is not a major issue when you can just assign hunting and basic ranged military training to all burrowed dwarves (such as basic battle maid training at temple for all new women).

&amp;#x200b;

3. migrant processing - the sheer level of work required to process migrants is greatly diminished. while future versions of dwarf fortress may use the tavern system with greater control over who gets in based on their role and therefore no longer have this issue, as things stand simply dumping half of all arrivals into the army greatly reduces the strain of larger waves. however, again, you might not always get the best fit (but who checks each of dozens, if not hundreds, of dwarves?).

&amp;#x200b;

4. less idlers - having pre-planned roles keeps everyone working at peak performance. men are always either training or fighting, women start as maids with a communal dormitory above the tavern. keeping a clean fortress may seem demeaning... until you consider the horrors of tracked forgotten beast blood  resulting in a fortress of footless dwarves crawling in that foul poison until all is lost.

&amp;#x200b;

5. protecting future generation - while the legendary dwarven battle maids have produced fine warriors trained from birth in the art of war and toughened by grueling hardship as a living shield, such a life all too often proves more than a mere new born (even a dwarven one) can handle. keeping babies and their caretakers safe from the cruel reality of their world"

69,"the hippie caravan brought a ≡pitch-black fabric isalo strings≡ that was worth, like, *stupid money*. lucky for them our fortress has stupid money in surplus. so i bought it, thinking i could assemble an isalo that would be worth even *stupider* amounts of money.  

isalos happen to be (in case you even care) large stationary stringed instruments with a wooden body and fabric strings. just 2 parts. easy, right?  

i restricted a shop to a legendary woodworker and looked for ""craft isalo body,"" but no... they're foreign.  

no worries though, the caravan's still here and they've got a shitty -grown willow isalo body- we can use. i'll just decorate the hell out the finished product and it'll still be worth megabux...

78,"it was mid-granite by the time i had reached my appointed destination, a small plot of land west of the mountains and north of our main population. while the land itself was hospitable, with a warm climate and bountiful supplies of lumber, plants and raw sand, it was well within reach of both warring goblin to the east and twin citadels of dark power to the north-east and south-east (not to mention to vast hordes of dirty knife-ears who surround me). undoubtedly, there are also kobolds in the mountain caves west, but i expect little trouble of them.

https://i.redd.it/qmf4d5oonsz11.png

i immediately excused my six traveling companions, whose names elude me despite our long journey together, as their mission was merely to escort me to my strategic post. none had volunteered to join me on my noble mission, or even shared my grand vision. indeed, most thought my dreams mad at best and near-treasonous at worst. however, my kind are nothing if not harder and more stubborn than the rocks in which live, and i refused to be dissuaded from my dream. indeed, the very fate of my people may hinge upon my glorious work here.

&amp;#x200b;

the plan is one of elegant simplicity: build an impenetrable fortress beneath the surface, stock it with the finest of craftwork, and hire a vast army of mercenaries to use in strategic raids until all enemies of dwarvenkind have parished from the world. the design is based around a massive pit measuring 33 urists by 33 urists widening slightly as it descends to prevent climbers from entering. this shall be filled with sand fallen from above and the center of the pit shall be a massive tower-ramp corkscrewing down to the base of the pit and connected by twin retracting drawbridges at the southern end so that our brethren may enter in times of peace. the sides of the tower shall be left open so that arrows may rain upon any hostile who manages to enter it's reaches.  great halls shall be carved into the stone surrounding the pit to provide accommodations, workshops and storerooms sufficient to handle the necessary logistics of our task.

&amp;#x200b;

towards this end, i set about carving a massive hall into the stone immediately beneath the soil measuring 21 urists by 21 urists to serve as my temporary base of operations and storeroom until more final accommodations can be made. stocks were in good order, with a hundred units of various brews and half as many weights of mountain goat jerky, and my defenses were sufficient with the roughly 45 dogs i'd brought along for protection, so i was able to focus fully on my task without interruption other to eat, sleep and drink. the injuries on one of my dogs suggest an attack by a massive insect of some kind (perhaps a fly?), but i missed the event entirely due to my work. no matter, such trifling occurrences are nothing to what will come.

&amp;#x200b;

by the 14th of felsite, i was finished. next, i required lumber and basic furnishings, so i set about felling a small grove of trees by the entry stairs. other than a stray deer being wounded by a few of my more overly zealous dogs, everything went without a hitch. shame i couldn't risk hunting it down... a little variety at dinner would be appreciated. still, a broken leg alone could well spell my doom, so i let the poor beast escape. 

https://i.redd.it/08emy9h7osz11.png

&amp;#x200b;

after that, i designated some space for basic stocks within my chamber, and set plans for a simple larch wood trade depot to prepare for an early summer caravan. it never hurts to be hopeful, although neither should one be foolish enough to let those hopes overshadow their plans and preparations. a quick drink and i set to storing the wood (lest it's presence embolden the kobolds). still, the sight of my dogs mutilating another dear gives me a sense of security. i doubt anything but a small army might get to me as it stands.

https://i.redd.it/vign9iovosz11.png

early summer saw our first worthy foe, a giant she-fox from the wilds. while my dogs swarmed the massive beast and stained the ground red with it's blood, she did considerable damage to the pack before terror took her to run. shame they didn't kill it, the pelt would have been a fine trophy. still, it makes me consider the costs of my defense. 40 of my pack are bitches, so losses should be regained quickly... but i'd rather not lose any i might need against a raid, or their potential offspring. perhaps a few traps would be in order after i've built the depot.

https://i.redd.it/788y6rd4psz11.png

by midsummer, i decided hauling must wait until i finished the depot. i'd tried my luck far too long as it is, and i cannot risk losing access to a trade shipment (not that i have much to offer. the fox, which had circled our camp for several days but lacked the courage for an outright attack, has finally left. in it's place, a red panda sow has come. strange creature, but it seems to be no real threat.

i've set out designs for a carpenter, mason, craftdwarf and mechanic workshops of larch wood, and cut down a walnut tree for beds and other furnishings. i tend to be particular about my tastes. on the 23 of malachite, a group of five travelers arrived seeking refuge. however, upon hearing of my plans and their proximity to enemy forces, they decided it better to seek more fertile prospects in the east. it is still not autumn, and i have yet to finish hauling wood. indeed, i have come to regret greatly my zeal in cutting down so many trees when only one or two would more than have sufficed. soon, the leaves start to fall.

https://i.redd.it/wf6v10ecpsz11.png

with autumn comes not the caravan for which i'd hoped, but rather an invasion of the dead come to put a stop to my plans. they are eleven strong of raised knife-ears, and followed by a flock of five raven drawn to feed upon the waste of my fortress, or perhaps even as spies for their dark master. worse, their master has come to lead them, a fell wren woman by the name of katthir gebmisten who used her powers of flight to avoid detection and get the drop on me. i quickly flee to the wagon and the protection of my pack, but i know this fight is over the moment she wills it. her minions can slaughter my pack, and she can raise them anew from the safety of the air without fear of reprisal. i lack even a door to bar them from my chambers, but...

https://i.redd.it/tol20gqopsz11.png

&amp;#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/ru14t7zxpsz11.png

&amp;#x200b;

yes, that's it! quickly, i call my pack and make a mad rush for the chamber stairs. if she will have this fort, she will have to fight for it! i will not let her pick us apart, but rather force her to come down to my level and fight on my terms. within the chamber she cannot fly, nor can she raise our fallen nor her own from the air. it's a risky venture, but far safer than waiting to die on the surface like a dirty knife-ear or lumbering man-beast... let us meet glory with honor!

https://i.redd.it/tcl2loqdqsz11.png

and not a moment too late, for the dead are upon us and one of my breeding pair of horses falls to the arrows of those rotting fiends before he can reach the stairs. i hear its anguished screams, and know with silent dread that it will make the stair oh so soon. i steel my will and ready myself for battle as the slowly torment the beast above, gathering closer with each moment. in the tradition of my people, i call out a name for my company: the words of painting. immediately, i regret it, but haste and panic have sealed my passage in history under the floweriest of banners. my ancestors will never let me live this down, but living in any form will be no concern of mine...

https://i.redd.it/offtpnkvqsz11.png

the battle (or, more aptly, slaughter) rages on above as two of them makes their way down. fiercely, my pack rushes forward despite their utter lack of training and i utter a silent prayer thanking the powers that be for their insane aggression before i rush forward and... and...

https://i.redd.it/6vunglv6rsz11.png

and a deep terror rips through my heart down to my very soul as the elf bowmans dead, listless eyes lock with mine. i cannot bring myself near such a beast, and cowardice shames me as i fall back and wait for them to finish my pack... i hope the dogs will rip them to shreds, but the stories of these monsters let me know better. if only i could wall myself into a corner and hide, but then what? wait to starve while my undying pack claws at the rocks baying for me, for my blood and flesh? no, what horror have i wrought upon myself? what madness drove me here? why didn't i run when i had the chance? i am a fool, a damned fool condemned by his arrogance and folly! dogs? dogs!?! what was i even thinking? how could they stand against the perils of the world?

&amp;#x200b;

above, the horse screams again, fallen and both legs useless and the undead make sport of it, enjoying it's torment and pain, and the fear that torment and pain cause in those hiding below. my dogs rage on, unbroken and unfailing... and i slink further back in shame. no, this cannot be my fate! i was meant for glory!!! for riches and fame!!! what cruel joke is this!?! how can this even be!?! all my dreams come crashing down before my eyes, and i know they were right... i am mad, i am... no!!! this isn't over yet!

&amp;#x200b;

again, i try to set my will and fight... but to no avail. blood of dogs and dead mingles with broken parts of each on the floor. i can see the tiredness of my pack, and slowly their injuries grow. it is only a matter of time before this ends...

&amp;#x200b;

i can hear another of their fell number coming down the stairs, and the rest close in as they tire of their sport. he lingers for a moment before entering, and then another is behind him. more soon follow, and the horse above makes a mad dash away. odd to think the one certain of death might be the only survivor as we trapped ourselves in this tomb, our only escape through that horde and it's horrors.

&amp;#x200b;

five now stand in the chambers, and i can hear three more above at the entrance above the bays and grows of my pack. we outnumber them almost four to one, yet our enemy does not know pain or weariness as we do. again, i try to overcome my fear, but cannot. a dog joins me in terror, and another falls. one less protector... one step closer to death.

https://i.redd.it/4thtuufrrsz11.png

more dogs give in to fright. gore now cover much of the floor: bits of teeth, blood, fingers, toes... yet they just keep coming, uncaring of their injuries. six of my pack now lie dead, then another and another until its twelve... and more come down the stairs. seven of those wretched knife-eared corpses now revel in the stench of blood and death and dirt. three more dogs fall. still, i linger on the edge. nowhere to run, nowhere to hide... i can only watch in horror and wait my turn.

&amp;#x200b;

more enter the chamber, and over half my pack is dead. my only solace is that the flapping wings long since quieted, and we may rest in peace after they are done with us. 32 now have fallen, and not one of them is the enemy. truly, we were outmatched before this even began. another dog flees to join me in the corner, a whelp with brown fur and grey ears. i'd send him back, but what's the point. i pet him gently and whisper ""don't worry... don't worry... it will all be over soon."". only seven dogs are left alive.

https://i.redd.it/2gilqziessz11.png

at some point, the mare fell. above, i hear it mate cry out in agony as it crawls towards the stairs. four dogs left, two of them running in fear... nope, better just make that two dogs. looks like i'm up, whether i want it or not. i wonder glumly if it would even have mattered if i had fought, if maybe i could have turned the tide enough to prevent this fate... oh well, doesn't matter much now.

&amp;#x200b;

the bodies of dead dogs litter the floor in piles, parts strewn about the floors in pools and streams of running blood. slowly, the dead turn... slowly, painfully, they begin to come...

https://i.redd.it/5lnqgwbpssz11.png

blind terror and panic rips through me. i make a mad dash for the door, smashing past one and barreling over another... wait, what that warmth? that wetness? that pain? the last two dogs fall as i stare in down in horror, transfixed... i'm dead already, i know that much. my right hand is gone, nothing but mangled gore and bone splinters where it used to be flopping around on a shattered mess that was my wrist, my guts pouring out in a twisted mess, blood pour from my neck and head, my whole body aching... how did this happen? i thought they were slow... i thought... horror grasps me again as i reach for my head and touch something soft, squishy... my brain? i try to run again, but slip in my blood and fall into two more.

https://i.redd.it/oov2wm4xssz11.png

&amp;#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/4uonbt77tsz11.png

so much blood... so much pain... can't i just die? why don't they finish me? i hear a horrid, gurgling scream, only to realize that it's me screaming. tears blur my vision. the door... the door is so close! i can make it! just a little bit... farther... and...

https://i.redd.it/0sv2xdxatsz11.png

&amp;#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/n7go44fgtsz11.png

i'm just so tired... so very tired... the pain starts to fade as the dead crowd around me. no, those fools... i've almost gone... the door... is right... there... i... can still... make... it........

https://i.redd.it/c5dzjhmstsz11.png

&amp;#x200b;

https://i.redd.it/86i752cztsz11.png

i can't stand, so i crawl through the mix of blood and bits of dead and the bodies of my pets. light shines down the stairs, so bright... so very bright.

anyone up for succession?"
79,"nothing too scary. temperate woodlands. no reanimating or thralling. just nonstop goblin blood rain. should be fun, right?  

i dug an extra long ""welcome tunnel"" for any invaders, and plopped some military barracks on the surface with a constructed roof to keep off the blood rain. below ground, we've got plenty of ore and gems but no smiths or jewelers yet.  no big deal, we can carve stuff or sell spiked wooden balls. gotta do something with all that glumprong wood, right?  

the blood was making a complete mess so i built a 3 square wide mist generator in the entrance tunnel, fed from a stream uphill. no pumps required. it drains into the first cavern layer. works great. only 4 residents have died in the caverns, so not too bad really. one was destroyed by a gcs. one was shaken about by the head in an encounter with a giant cave toad. the other two were drunk human monster slayers who drowned in the flooded part of the caverns.  no big deal. if need be our military squads can handle trolls and giant cave crocodiles.  

we seem to have missed the 2nd cavern layer. the 3rd cavern layer is nearly ready to get opened up. so far, just one observation room with fortifications carved, and a drawbridge and cage traps in case things get nuts. nethercap trees can be seen just beyond the fortification slits. and we've finally found a massive deposit of marble for steelmaking.  

besides the lack of !!fun!! the strangest thing was the elven caravan. they got rained on. one of their pack camels got stuck a d took nearly a month to get to our trade depot. they left before they were able to finish unpacking. oh well. the only interesting thing they had was a trained grizzly bear, but to heck with those hippies. we're gonna capture our own giant cave crocodiles and breed them. yeah. or maye the long-awaited !!fun!! will finally arrive.  

we're getting so lax with security there are even some above ground farm plots, with rooves build over them to keep the blood rain off. lots of urists like fisherberries and kaniwa... so you know. priorities."

81,"i wanted to know what these spikes of activity were being caused by, long after the defining wars and battles had taken place. it seems to occur in predictable 150 year cycles just as the age of the goblin began.

[all world events](https://i.redd.it/z54ffrt4upz11.png)

i checked each type of filtered data to see what was causing this.

i found that most of the activity spikes were due to historical figures dying.

[historical figure deaths](https://i.redd.it/fqtl7hchtpz11.png)

then i found matching spikes with historical figures being linked to entities(govenrments/civs).

[historical figure being linked as an enemy](https://i.redd.it/3qzzognltpz11.png)

this data told me one thing: werebeast attacks. rhinoceros monster to be exact.

i also found a similar spiking pattern from abductions which told me they somehow correlate with the werebeast attacks.

[historical figure abduction](https://i.redd.it/df0up5notpz11.png)

the question remains: what caused this pattern to form? why is it a pattern at all, instead of sporadic activity?

my theory is that the attacks are somehow hard-coded to take place at a certain point.

any ideas?"
82,"on the wiki l, there are some suggestions for how to alter certain speech txt files to give people more dialogue in adventure mode, but most of them vary in tone, and not all of them mesh together. besides, in order to implement the suggestions you would have to edit your files manually, which can be very tedious.

i haven't found any mods that solely alter dialogue and are meant for the current version, so now i'm wondering if anyone here would be interested if i were to make one!

it's a small change, something that only really affects flavor text, but i think it's nice to have more variety! what do you think?"
83,"so i have a map of what i am trying to figure out and master in this game. i need to figure out pumps, i have a few triumphs but no consistent successes. i have farming 90% figured out but that could use some work. i got a military figured out if i can accidentally get my food going strong. i need to figure out what makes dwarfs happy and how to implement that. i need to figure out draw bridges, i have yet to get any further along with them other than ""and if i am reading this right i have installed a draw bridge from there to there with no way to get it up or down"". 

so i would like to hear where you guys are at? what is the next step you are trying to get all set up? what is the step that you recently mastered allowing you to explore new aspects of dwarven mishaps?"
84,"greetings fellow beards!

i was wondering about this for a long time, so today i finally got some time and decided to test this hypothesis.

so, here is what i did: i changed the object testing arena layout, so that there is a long hallway, 1 tile wide, going across 7 z-levels, connecting them by ramps. 2 dwarves were spawned, one at the lowest point of the hallway, and the other at the highest point. i ran 5 fight configurations, and run each fight configuration 100 times to see whether one side would have advantage (or disadvantage).

here are the configurations and their results:

1. configuration - unarmed dwarves, both of them at proficient skill level - the higher ground dwarf won 51% of times.
2. configuration - dwarves with iron short swords, unarmoured, and both of them at proficient skill level - the higher ground dwarf won 52% of times.
3. configuration - dwarves with iron spears, unarmoured, and both at the proficient skill level - the higher ground dwarf won 48% of times.
4. configuration - dwarves with silver warhammers, unarmoured, and both at the proficient skill level - the higher ground dwarf won 49% of times.
5. configuraiton - dwarves with iron crossbows and iron bolts, unarmoured, and both at the proficient skill level - the higher ground dwarf won 51% of times.

&amp;#x200b;

conclusion: based on the results, i think that there is no higher ground advantage modeled in the game. so it doesn't seem to matter if you're fighting an enemy who is at the greater height than you, the height difference won't matter in the outcome of the battle."
85,"while yes, we have ""rock swords"" made from obsidian, it'd also be nice to be able to make particularly early game weapons made from knapped stone, that is, stone swords made from certain types of rock that have a ""knappable"" tag, this tag could also potentially be able to be used to make rock bolts, needing wood to make the body (higher quality than standard wooden arrows, but lower quality than any kind of metal)"
86,"captured beak dogs during invasion.

87,"so i was looking around in legends viewer when i found a civilization of kobolds that was entirely separated from the rest of the world on their tiny private subarctic continent. when i took a closer look i found that it consisted of a single kobold with close to a hundred domesticated giant cave spiders. i wonder what's going on in this guys head.

&amp;#x200b;

sorry for this long time without any information. fear not, i'm still working on the board game of dwarf fortress, but my life is pretty filled with a lot of stuff right now, so i'm getting slowed a lot. the rules are dones and i've got some blank cards for building up a prototype.

&amp;#x200b;

i really want to show some pics of the prototype soon !

strike the earth !"
89,"i recently started playing this game again after about 4 years away from it. in my newest fortress today, something strange happened that i'd never seen before. i didn't even know it was possible, but when the first caravan arrived, the outpost liaison who came with it was a goblin of all things! after about 1000 years of history generation i guess he got adopted into my civilization at some point. i love that this game always surprises me with odd coincidences like this even after so many years playing it!"
90,"this game.

so i have been streaming df regularly twice a week for a few weeks now and i've been getting better and better, more used to mechanics and various things. yet one of my fortresses fell to a zombie invasion and a tantrum spiral. right i said, time to start anew.

enter claspcharms, a dwarven fortress in the foothills of the mountians, nothing special. first job learn how to build a bridge and towers. done. 

second job, make use of the iron, coal and flux i found to make steel. 

then lose some miners to flooding, its all !fun!. 

anyway this is normal df, then it started getting interesting. i had a look at my fortress in legends to see what the world was doing and i found out that claspcharms was the last stronghold of a dwarven civ, one that hadn't held land in 80 years after an elven onslaught. https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/9xn06d/so_started_a_new_fortress_on_stream_this_week/ this is the legends screen.

so it was now my mission to rebuild the civ from the ground up, i joked to myself. i honestly thought df isn't a war game of grand strategy where i need to conquer land and things, but hey i'll have fun with my viewers. (a little side plug check it out here https://www.twitch.tv/lowesypc)

now i like to let my viewers name dwarves and other things, to allowed for greater connection to the game and emotional trauma when !fun! happens. one viewer by the name of sax wanted to be the most useless dwarf. ok then. messenger you are. 

fast forward to today. i boot up the stream and focus on getting an archery group, houses and the hospital all set up. then i think lets get some manager automation and get the steel industry and armour going. 

soon i have dwarves getting equipped and training in shiny steel armour. then i think about doing some missions. never done them before should probably see what they are about. shoutout to u/twistedminds for telling more about on the bi-weekly questions thread. 

i decided to make a note of all the lands that once belonged to our civ, the stern bolts. and i started to explore. the first place came up empty. then i remembered that the king was still alive and being guarded by one elf in the old fortress of ledsteel. i equipped my squads and they rolled out to rescue and show these elven scum that after 80 years the stern bolts were not yet dead. 

it took them many days to get there, in the mean time i focused on my fort and thought about a grand project. a moria style great hall with large pillars and a palace at the end for the king that i hoped to rescue. then i get a pop up. 

sax the messenger had decided to discuss with her rivals about becoming queen of the stern bolts. i got very confused. 

after a few days of panicking i exclaimed where are my troops, i hope they haven't died. and as with sax proclaiming herself queen after i discussed a throne room, the boys and girls of the claspcharms militia returned. victorious with plunder from ledsteel's laundry basket. 

i read the reports. they had surprised the elf and slew her with ease. then they slew the king kogsak machinecrimson. it seemed that despite being king of the stern bolts he had thrown his lot in with the elves and was not more than a dog on a leash. therefore he was slain. 

he died on the 23rd of helsite. sax proclaimed herself queen the next day. the war that was quiet for 80 years was back on.

tl:dr. went to rescue the king from the elves, found out he was working with them and killed him. holy shit this game man."
91,"so, after spending the past hour and a half or so trying to generate the perfect world with a lonely mountain or something like [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/9yc2c0/a_nice_little_mountain/) had, i found this bizarre thing.

95,"so i made a dingo man, realized i was too small to fit into my civ's dwarven clothes, accidentally stole a bunch of gems from my own civ because nobody seemed to mind until i tried to leave...and couldn't find anyone to buy them anyways...then i got my companion to carry my backpack full of stolen gems and all my weapons, only to have him refuse on pain of death to return any of it to me. so i tried to wrestle it back from him and got murdered immediately.

it's a rough world out there...lol"
96,"(entirely default df, with only a few changes to the controls because i'm new)

adventure mode: the quiet shell, a land of savagery and filth.

one lone adventurer pays a visit to a mine some 3 hours away from the nearest settlement, it is a quiet summer morning...

the adventurers name is entante (pronounced an-tant) hellstorm, a fearless, stress ignoring brown-recluse-spider man with next to no real cares or religions (he thinks their all stupid political shit) of any kind. he has black eyes, a muscular build, and a nack for hunting just about anything he sees in hopes of finding a trader one day. fortunately, he stole an axe (named soul destroyer by its former owner because of its high killcount at 377) in the last town over, but couldn't find a pick to mine anything with.

about 3 layers down into the mine he smells and senses tracks of the forgotten beast morocanth, a great fire-breathing hairless winged many armed blind lobster. rather than straight up charging in with no regard of his own sense of direction, he instead comes up with an interesting idea. back in the last town he heard an elf go on about how spider webs on traps allow you to cage any animal, regardless of size, allegiance, or difficulty to catch. he found a random cage trap about 3 days ago while hunting, and set it up in the caves, then sprayed his silk on it and hid, making sure to leave the passive animals in the cave alone...

a good while later the roar of morocanth is heard very close by, and looking through the hall, the beast is headed straight for him. entante sprints straight for the cover he found near his trap, and just in time too, as the beast sprayed a great deadly fire in his direction, but fails to hit entante, after about a minute of waiting the cage finally activates and snaps morocanth into the trap, clasping for entante but not able to attack. after dragging morocanth out into the entrance of the cavern he uses the animals morocanth killed, and butchers every last one of them with the axe he stole, only to use to tame morocanth. it took 3 days of hard work, and entante had to both get morocanth close to the village and hunt for morocanths food, but he was able to successfully tame morocanth to the point where he could release and ride morocanth. needless to say he had a much easier time with just about everything he needed to do.

99,"i was being foolish, digging around with my two miners down near the last cavern (i think, i might have missed the first). i'm playing the masterwork mod, and i accidentally breached a wall. i say to myself ""alright, i'll just patch this up, enable my miner's construction in labors, and be on my merry way."" little did poor me know, several very scary armored bug creatures beelined for the opening., and my miner refused to build the wall. they quickly dispatched my poor second miner, and scurried up my long staircase. i put everyone in a burrow at the front, and had them beat the first one to death (literally no militia as i've been waiting to make weapons but can't find any freaking flux) i'm currently saving my game, wish me luck and i'll update with how my fortress fairs. "
100,then chained ettin vampire killed one of my axedwarves.
101,"&amp;#x200b;

[jk it's too heavy =\[](https://i.redd.it/4f8wso273xy11.png)"
102,"so, i generated a nice little world. the world known as the land of enchanting:

a land of many artifacts, beasts, and wars. the dwarven civilization is falling slowly, the goblins wont let up their endless attacks, they have the advantage in numbers.

but this story is centered around a single dwarf, a hammerdwarf named datan mirroredcrushed. a fortress guard of laboreddawned. but there was something about datan nobody else knew. he was a worshipper of ning, the god of chaos. datan worked his way up to fortress guard to hide his true goal. what's that goal, you may ask? to acquire an artifact, ordered by his god. the very artifact is held in laboreddawned, by a goblin count, cog canyonmerchant.

the root of stroking, a legendary iron war hammer. given to cog to be used as a symbol of authority for the dwarven civilization, the virtuous steel. datan wanted this hammer. he wanted to wield this hammer to end all who appose his god, especially goblins and those damned elves. but no, not yet. he couldn't just walk up to cog and kill him, he'd be overwhelmed by the other people. he'd have to gain fame, so nobody will suspect datan as the murderer.

datan worked his way up the social ladder. he was ordered to kill a roc. and so, he did. using... less than heroic strategies by using friendly goblins as bait. nobody has to know about that. datan murdered the roc, and was considered a hero. when he returned home, everyone celebrated. but not datan. he asked for an official meeting with the count, cog, under the guise of wanting to enjoy a heroic drink with someone so official on this momentous occasion.

nobody knew where cog was.

datan searched the fortress for hours, looking for cog. but he was nowhere.
so, he rested for a week. gathering information. it seemed like cog just... straight up disappeared. along with that hammer. datan was pissed. but eventually, he managed to get some information out of someone.
""he ran to torchpraised. i don't know why, but he did.""

perhaps datan wasn't so good at hiding his motives... but no matter. to torchpraised he goes. it was a short journey, just two days of travel. torchpraised is a grand fortress of nobles. here is where datan hopes to make history, to make a new era. he went deep into the fortress, looking for his target. and... hold on... it seems like the god of chaos is making his mark here, there are people and nobles fighting each-other. very strange.. perhaps there are more worshipers of the god of chaos than datan thought.

then he turns the corner. he sees the queen of the virtuous steel fighting an angry baron, but more importantly, he sees cog canyonmerchant, cowering in the corner from all this chaos. the baron attacking the queen- the countess attacking a peasant, there is just so much going on here. but that doesn't matter, datan enjoys the chaos- so he decided to partake in it.

datan ran up to cog and demanded the hammer, but... cog didn't have it. in a rage, datan attacked cog, the two having a fight amongst the chaos. fists were thrown, hammers were tossed. and ultimately, datan came up on top. but not for long.

the others attacked datan, the more sane individuals that is. datan got cocky, he let his guard down. taking several horrible blows, he falls to the ground, fighting to his last breath. there, he was slain- in the depths of torchpraised, in a slurry of chaos.

but the question still remains: where was the hammer? well, it seems as if cog hid the hammer away in that fortress. will the god of chaos be able to obtain it? time will tell.


all of this happened in-game. dwarf fortress is bloody amazing."

112,"hello everyone!

ive always had a deep love of dw and all the unique stories and items that you have all experienced and collected, so now i ask you, whats some of the best stories that you guys have seen or made, and interesting items that have fallen in and out of your possessions? 

(if this is in the wrong sub reddit please let me know)"
113,"i've been playing around with character customization (specifically in adventure mode), and after having fun with the change-appearance script and editing some attributes of my character i looked into changing the mannerisms of my character (e.g. ""snaps fingers when thinking"" or ""speaks deliberately when angry."").  no other documentation has been published on this matter, and i don't think anyone has ever tried this before (granted, until recently, you couldn't see your adventurer's mannerisms).  so, i decided to go in there and conduct some !!science!! on editing mannerisms, and it's indeed possible.


if you use dfhack's gui/gm-editor command, you can find where almost anything is stored.  probably due to the fact that no one has ever looked into mannerisms, they're not labelled in the gm editor, but they can be accessed through 


&gt;  status.current_soul.personality.unk5.


of course, since there's no documentation, what you see is some numbers you don't understand.  but not to worry, you're actually being presented with some values representing your character's attributes.  in its present state, it's impossible to tell what values mean what, but that's where i come in!


when you go into one of the values in unk5 (say 0), you'll be presented with two more values, unk1 and unk2.  unk1 defines what kind of mannerism you're character has, while unk2 is a context sensitive modifier that changes some part of the mannerism while keeping the mannerism as a whole same.  for example, if you have a ""winking"" mannerism (mannerism 56, by the way, more on that later), having an unk2 value of 1-8 makes your mannerism ""(s)he is quick to wink at others"", a value of 9 makes your mannerism ""(s)he winks during conversations"", and a value of 10 (max) makes your mannerism ""(s)he winks as a form of greeting.""  i'm not entirely sure about which modifier values will correlate to which mannerism mods, but it's easy enough to play within those ten values yourself.


as for the mannerisms themselves, there's a staggering number of them.  i counted 61 separate modifiers, and there's possibly 64: i found three blank numbers in the sequence, but it's possible that they were blank just for the modifier val that i was using.


i compiled a list of mannerisms that i dug up, with an unk2 value of 5.  each number in the list represents the unk1 value.  for most of these, that means ""*does mannerism* when thinking"", so you'll see a lot of that.  i'm sure if you changed the unk2 value you could get a ""*does mannerism* when angry"", but as i said, it's easy enough to play with it yourself.  [you can view the list here.](https://pastebin.com/vh2xseuj).  i categorized them by raw tag as well: i listed the speech ones as ""mannerism_tongue"", but come to think of it they're probably ""mannerism_breath"" (mannerism_tongue is accounted for later).  also, i have no idea where ""gives out hugs freely"" would go: mannerism_arms, maybe?


let me know what you guys think and if you have any more discoveries!"
114,"i was thinking, if there's so many accurate descriptions of things in your world, why isn't there a small wall of text anywhere describing celestial bodies? even something as simple as the number of suns/moons of the planet sparks my interest a little. maybe there could be even constellations that could be origin to myths in different civs (if we're looking for tie-ins to religion/mythology i might as well include the obvious connection between suns, moons, and planets and gods).   
i don't know, just something i thought might have been interesting. if you have ideas/opinions/info about this i would be super interested in hearing about it!"
115,"[in a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/9v96q7/14398_lay_dead_in_the_snow/), i showed how over fourteen thousand died in a single, horrific battle. after some more investigation, i learned what goblin pillaging is all about. the defeated aren't just laying dead in the snow..

118,"hello people,  


today i was planning on starting a new fort, and i decided to start by picking a civilization and studying it in further detail in the legend viewer.  
such fascinating world generation this game has. my civilization has historical figures and wars. heroes have lived and died, and it even has it's own styles of poetry, dancing and music.  


but, more specifically, i noted my civilization has holidays, specifically, the 08-26 is the cobalt festival, and the 10-19 is the celebration of hames.

  


https://i.redd.it/drkr3pgpbkx11.png

i am curious about how this holidays, or ""processions"" as legend viewer calls it, work. what mechanics do they have in the game, and if there is anything that i, as a player handling a fortress, can do to take part in such events."
119,"i was playing an adventurer named imami(i think its supposed to be that, enabling twbt breaks everything and there is a weird character in his name that i can't figure out). he was actually an assassin - specifically, he was an outsider trained in stealth and knife usage that traveled the world under countless false identities tracking down valuable artifacts and people that, for whatever reason, needed to die. as of right now he's assassinated a law giver, a general, a militia commander, a local lord leading an attack on a nearby town, and the priest im going to talk about here.

so i was currently going after a valuable scroll in the city i had lodgings in at the time (i believe i chose it because it was an easy thing to carry around and have to sell for anything that i need). it was held by a priest, the name of which i cannot recall, and so travelled to the temple in which he stayed. i quietly made my way up the levels, interrogating each priest i saw along the way. eventually, i found him on the very top level of the temple. the rooftop. he was almost at the edge of the plaza. i went up to him, exchanged greetings, confirmed he had the scroll, and promptly stabbed him in the chest.

nothing meant to kill him, of course. i just wanted to… grab his attention. get him to yield. i demanded he drop the scroll - he complied eagerly - and i grabbed it off the ground. went to grab him to finish the job - and missed. he managed to get a tile out of reach in the meantime, and i started chasing him. however, after only a few tiles i could tell it would be a long chase - and one where i’d be revealed, if i didn’t kill him. i introduced myself with my real name when i talked to him instead of an identity, so i didn’t want him to tell anyone how “not two hours ago in this location, imami attacked me”. i needed to get him.

then inspiration struck. i looked out over the side of the temple. there was a roof below. i ran all the way to the other side of the temple, then sprinted back and jumped right off the top of a 5 floor temple, onto a roof, then ran north until i reached the end of the building and then jumped again down to ground level. i managed to intercept the priest just as he was going down to the first level. a few steps later, he was unconscious and dying of a slit throat.

so thats the story of how an adventurous assassin managed to steal a scroll from a priest, engage in a brief footchasee, and then perform some acrobatics to jump off of two rooftops unscathed and then execute his target, and all within 10 minutes. just thought i’d like to share.

125,"the detail that is possible, despite random generation, is just crazy.  every world feels so unique.

i generated a couple worlds waiting for a layout that i found interesting... and i'm sure that a lot of it's features would be found to be ""meh"" by a playerbase that has been playing for a long time but it's super fascinating to me.

for instance, i have an island in the southwest that has a human civilization of harbor towns.  cut off from the rest of the mainland, unfettered by the politics of the other civilizations, life is peaceful... except that there is a necromancer tower in the center building an army.  also, no other civilization has as many night creature attacks, dragging people off and raping them.  will they ever secure their island?  even though it has a name already, i call the island ""innistrad"".

the dwarven civilization in the south-central mountain is the smallest civilization, but has never been to war and is home of the largest library in existence.  and the library is run by thousands of elves?!  going for a cultural victory i guess.

i love this world already.  i can't wait to have fun.

126,"i've always struggled to find comprehensive instructions on how to go about manually updating the current lmp to work with newer versions of dwarf fortress, dfhack etc. after learning what i can from other snippets of information out there, and a lot of trial and error, here is my guide on updating the lazy mac pack. i've done this for the past few versions and everything has worked well, i can't know if some update in the future might change the requirements though! (sorry future dworfs)

i won't be covering how to use lmp in detail as i expect most people who are using it will know how to add tilesets, mods, and change settings in the lmp, and if not there are better resources out there on learning to do so.

#manually updating lazy mac pack  
start by downloading the latest versions of everything you will need.

* **lazy mac pack** - http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=158322.0
* **dwarf fortress** - http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/
* **dfhack** - https://github.com/dfhack/dfhack/releases
* **twbt (text will be text)** - https://github.com/mifki/df-twbt/releases
* **dwarf therapist** - https://github.com/dwarf-therapist/dwarf-therapist/releases/

note: it usually takes time between game updates for dfhack and other utilities to be updated. sometimes older version will work well enough, sometimes things are broken. update what you can and test them.

##lazy mac pack setup  

**1)** delete the dwarf fortress folder contained in lazy mac pack.  
**2)** copy the latest version of dwarf fortress into here.  

##dfhack setup  

**1)** unpack and copy the dfhack files into the dwarf fortress folder.  
**2)** rename ""*dfhack.init-example*"" to ""*dfhack.init*"".  

##twbt setup  
unpack and extract the twbt files to the following locations in your dwarf fortress folder.  

**1)** extract ""*twbt.plug.dylib*"" to hack/plugins.  
**2)** extract the pngs to data/art.  
**3)** extract ""*realcolors.lua*"" to hack/lua.  
**4)** extract ""*overrides.txt*"" to data/init.  

##updating dwarf therapist

**1)** copy and replace contents of ""*lmp &gt; utilities &gt; dwarf therapist*"" folder with the updated version.  

##running lazy mac pack

**1)** if using sierra and beyond, run the included shell script  
**2)** run lazy mac pack  
**3)** some tilesets will be missing from the graphics options due to being outdated. you can either manually add an updated version to the lmp graphics folder or find the tileset in the lmp folder, open the ""*manifest.json*"" file with a text editor, look for:  

     ""df_max_version"" 

 edit this value to be blank eg:

    ""df_max_version"": """",

**4)** when changing tilesets for the first time you may be prompted to download df, let this download and then you'll be able to change graphics packs. i'm not certain if this can be bypassed, i believe this installs some missing baseline files.  
**5)** play dwarf fortress!

___

**notes:**

if at any point your computer tells you that you're unable to run something due to being from an unidentified developer. ""*find the executable &gt; right click &gt; open*"". this will then give you an option to open it on the prompt. when you've done this once you won't have to again.

i'm not certain this is overall the most efficient way of updating the pack, i know there's some things out there that will build some mac compatible df packs, but this is just the way i've been updating the pack which has given me no problems so far. if anyone has any better ways of doing this or any improvements over how i've been doing it please let everyone know!

(i will try update with some more specific file paths later if anyone has problems finding where to put stuff)

129,"out of curiosity, i was wondering if i'm the only person who likes to play in the same world as much as possible.  i tend to create a new world when the one i'm currently playing bugs out and crashes whenever i try to play.  my longest world lasted about thirty years across three forts."
130,"puja starworship was a god among men in his community: a hearthperson for his local lord, physically fit far above the average, and unprecedented potential to go further beyond his current abilities.

starting out his next adventure in the calm nation in the timber of 125, puja asked his lord for orders. the lord replied almost offhandedly to investigate rumors concerning the husband of a moon freak in a lair to the north-northwest of their keep. a simple enough mission, one that would require the smallest amount of honest effort. 

the hearthperson recruited a local swordswoman and a spearwoman to assist him in this quest with honest doubt if they could do anything at all. keen to the strong possibility of meeting their death on the battlefield, they responded in gusto. they reasoned that if they were to fall, it would be in the most honorable way they could: in combat.

puja spent a whole day throwing small pebbles and defending against the local wolves to bring himself to his full potential. when dawn broke across the steppe, the three set off for the lair. unbeknownst to them, this would be the last time they would ever see their lord, their hamlet, or their homeland.

the mission was a success after a day of traveling. only the moon freak’s distorted husband was found in the lair. his caved in skull laid among the elf and human bone meal. mission success with not so much as a scratch on the band of wayward underlings.

the journey back to report to their feudal lord was a tiring one: after exterminating a flock of ravens and one wild tiger in an elven retreat, they stumbled in the fleeting evening light to find a tavern that would accept them. the sun set as they found a tavern that would serve as shelter and a possible source of better armaments and defenses.

instead of the uneventful tranquility they were expecting of a small hamlet’s tavern, they were greeted by bloodshed. elven and human prophets, beast hunters, and the like were laying waste to a hall full of elven and goblin performers. the three missionaries were dumbfounded by the sheer odds of such an encounter. not only was the keep much more bustling than the entire site, but it just so happened to be the battleground for an invasion. finding a place to ward off their fatigue for the night seemed fruitless at this point. 

unsure if the tide of battle would turn against them, they waited for the battle to die down. they concluded that they may as well wait to raid the spoils from the losing side. puja found it an ample opportunity to practice his speaking skills by telling the history of his lord. there was no assault upon him even after his performance was completed: perhaps their group was viewed as a neutral force among the combating forces. many laid dead both outside and within. broken carving knives and daggers were scattered amongst the bodies.

one of his underlings decided to jump into the fray, spelling the end for the man she swore herself loyal to. perhaps her bias against goblins swayed her reasoning; perhaps her disappointment of not being the one to kill their original target irked her, causing her to lash out in some attempt to achieve something; perhaps it was on a whim, seeing as the lasher they swore to follow could have supposedly taken on both sides by himself with no problems.

this proved to be quite possibly the worst mistake that puja had seen in his short career. the goblins and elves turned on puja’s group. the swordswoman fled, knowing that their end would be in vain would it to come from defending a foreign land. the initiating spearwoman got the worst treatment: she was surrounded and was beaten to death with all her vital spots avoided to prolong the pain.

puja starworship, the pride of his hamlet, the pinnacle of human genetics, was the oddity. he took one stray bronze bolt directly through the iron chain tunic that pierced and tore through his right lung. due to his poor visibility, he could not determine where the shot came from. whether it was premeditated or whether it was meant for the poet next to him, this was the only bit of damage that he sustained throughout the entire conflict. in some attempt to run away to prevent further damage, puja fled back into the tavern where only corpses were there to greet him. he no longer could know the status of his fellow teammates. soon afterwards, he became too weak to stand and short of breath. he never even reached midnight before he let out his final breath."

in my carelessness, i realise i have left a one-way path into the caverns that protects the dwarves from invasive evils, but not from their own greed and curiosity. i learn too late that the mayor was attempting to retrieve some spider webs that had accumulated in the cavern for the human caravan's perusal. 

resigned to his death, i prepare the appropriate slabs and carve out a new room in the great mausoleum, grit my teeth and unpause. aslot bilefrothy, the terrible one-eyed sauropod turns its baleful gaze upon the mayor, slavering with deadly spittle and brandishing its stinger. i open the combat reports, fearful to witness the grizzly demise of flamecity's well-beloved mayor...

the mayor strikes the forgotten beast in the head with his (-steel pick-), tearing the muscle, chipping the skull and tearing the brain! a tendon in the skull has been torn!
the (-steel pick-) has lodged firmly in the wound.

in the month of granite, year 210, a small group of dwarves set out into the unknown. these  7 dwarves were united only by their idealism and bravery. they had marched until they found a warm drizzly forest. here they decided to found their new society. it would start as a fortress, but it would grow to be a kingdom... or so they hoped.

149,"i tend to stay away from adventure mode due to its complexity and ease of getting killed by crossbow bolts but i wanted to try out a human halberdier because i think they're bad ass.

so, uzu helpkey is created and sets out with two companions to bust up some outlaws. the first camp was cleared by sneak attacks under the cover of darkness and uzu was feeling the blood lust. the second camp was attacked during the day and the first strike happened after probing and finding a lone outlaw master. not sure what master meant but charging in and taking swings showed that he had some insane dodge and parry skills. this guy actually ran away from uzu and was left to the companions to hopefully finish off. with foolish confidence uzu picked a swordsman closer to the camp to fight with. after several attacks and zero strikes landing on the swordsman, uzu gets his halberd arm exposed and sliced up enough for him to lose hold of it! once the blood starts flowing i feel the end coming and uzu dodges for his life while taking some easier strikes with his bronze shield even though the swordsman is clearly the better warrior and can dodge or parry each one. with uzu becoming pale and taking a bruising blow to the lower body he is able to strike an exposed ankle of his opponent which buckles under the force. he also see's his two companions running back to help! after countless dodges back toward his companions, uzu starts adding pressure once the swordsman is surrounded. he dropped his long sword after several attacks and uzu gives his opponent a warriors death. by repeatedly stabbing him with his own sword over and over because i assume the amount of blood loss uzu experienced has him laying down some minor paper cuts on the poor guy. clearing the rest of the site was significantly easier and even featured a beheading. uzu is going to get some rest after he finds his halberd amongst the blood and bodies.

&amp;#x200b;

i guess uzu needs to become a better fighter before he can be more reliable in landing hits at the start of a duel. i hope his hand is able to recover too but i think it is smashed to bits. gonna see how long i can keep uzu and try to start a site with him later down the line. if i get passed the constant dehydration and starvation from fast traveling."

i personally think he's really funny and an amazing chill personality, especially live, but even if he's played the game for hours and hours, i feel as though his knowledge of the game is limited to other df streamers/lpers.

to me, that's not a bad thing. if anything, it's a great starting point for new players to get into the game by watching someone playing for fun rather than playing to improve. i guess i can understand if veteran players get frustrated, but i've been playing dwarf fortress for a long time and i always enjoy his streams."

158,"started playing dwarf fortress again and decided to embark near tower. ended closer than expected.

[https://imgur.com/u72563y](https://imgur.com/u72563y)"
159,"tldr: sram (the expensive memory that makes up l1, l2, l3, and l4 caches on processors) has been increasing in speed and decreasing in its price, and may be df's best and only hope within the next decade.

&amp;#x200b;

tarn's continual investment of his time into the additions of systems rather than optimization has bothered me immensely over the years and since i was a teen i would get pissed off and just play starcraft instead. but as i've gotten older df has given me so much joy that i determined to do really do some in-depth digging to try and see what i could do *right now* that would really help me avoid fps death, including spending some money on hardware if it might help.

&amp;#x200b;

that led to about 40 hours' worth of digging. my system right now is an i5-6600k running 8mb single-channel at 2133mghtz, and at first i was hoping to be able to upgrade some portion of what i have to make the game run more smoothly. however, i was also ready to begin the planning stages of a total system upgrade in a year or two if it seemed feasible. in summary, here is what i found.

&amp;#x200b;

almost every system in df is entertwined. just look at a single round in combat: weather, temperature, dorf personality, recent dorf history, injury, location, armor quality, weapon quality, and combat skills like spear, armor user, shield user, dodger, kicker, and biter are read and written to *each round.* it has to happen each round because df gives xp on the basis of *each attack attempt,* and df checks to see if anything in any of the previously mentioned systems has changed within that turn -- which explains why sometimes a dorf, immediately upon witnessing another dorf's death or injury, might either flee in terror or become superhuman or might have no reaction. or why when *a ligament is torn* the dorf becomes useless. it's also why reading combat reports is so fun and interesting.

&amp;#x200b;

this constant checking of systems means that df is performing calculations and updating the results to the different systems all the time. when you consider that the above description is happening per combatant on each side *as well as* the dorfs inside who just walked through miasma or ate an excellent meal or were satisfied at work or whatever, it makes sense that cache memory, ram speed, and cpu speed matter most when it comes to optimizing df. tantrum spirals explain perfectly the insane interrelations and immediate ripple effects that have to be constantly calculated.

&amp;#x200b;

given that cache memory and cpu speed come together per cpu chip, and that replacing a cpu often means replacing the mobo too, i tried to see what could be done with ram alone in order to speed up the game.

&amp;#x200b;

turns out, not much.

&amp;#x200b;

i heavily investigated ram speed upgrades, since that seemed the easiest and simplest upgrade to make -- but it turns out that [ram speed has not really increased in over a decade.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cas_latency#memory_timing_examples) ddr3 ram was basically just as fast as the fastest current ddr4, and ddr5 only intends to decrease voltage while increasing density and bandwidth. neither density (how much ram can fit on a stick) nor bandwidth (how much memory can be accessed at a single time) is helpful to df, which benefits above all from being able to quickly and repeatedly read, make calculations, and write to the same small amount of info over and over and over. this reasoning also eliminated the possibility of help coming from dual- or quad-channelling ram.

&amp;#x200b;

so since ram offers no help, i looked into the possible benefits of putting df on a ramdrive. some others have done it, and posts all over the forum confirm: all the info df needs is already loaded into ram. putting the whole game on there does not help: it's already there.

&amp;#x200b;

in the end, dram (the ram on ram sticks) offers no hope for df improvement now or in the future. it has maxed itself out for df purposes. (dram may very well help computing systems which require increased bandwidth and density, but that's not df).

&amp;#x200b;

i then turned to the remaining two possibilities for improvement: cpu speed, and l1-l4 cache storage. from what i read, cache increases was more likely to help because df relies on at most 2 cores, so the modern trend in computing towards more cores in order to increase cpu speed doesn't help. 

&amp;#x200b;

l1-l4 cache is made up of sram which is a *much* faster and *much, much* more expensive version of dram. l1 is the fastest, with speed decreasing and size increasing from l1 through l4. the idea is that the cpu wants to have the most-used data *right there* for immediate access; if the data isn't in l1, it will check l2-4 in turn; then it'll go to ram to find it; if it isn't in ram, it'll go to ssd/hd to find it. the farther down that chain it goes, the slower the cpu is to get that information, and the slower a program runs.

&amp;#x200b;

as far as i understand it, modern computing has taken the following (very simplified) route in order to overcome the cpu-sram-dram-hd bottleneck. instead of asking for one data point at a time, waiting for that data point, and then doing one calculation with it -- which would benefit from an increase in transfer speeds -- multi-cored cpus use multithreading to ask for *a lot* of data points at one time, which benefit from increases in bandwidth by being able to ask for *a lot* of data all at once.   


using the typical vehicle/road analogy, df needs to improve in *either* the data transport vehicle getting much faster *or* the origin and destination points being brought closer together -- whereas the modern trend has chosen to increase the *number* of data transport vehicles, origins, *and* destinations by widening the roads (bandwidth) and creating more parking spots (cores). df's needs and the future of computing do not seem to coincide at all. except for one thing.

&amp;#x200b;

cpu caches (l1-l4) seem to be getting larger, faster, and cheaper at a regular rate, and the amount of new research in that area seems to be, well, exploding. the new amd ryzen processors, for example, have *much* larger amounts of cache than any previous desktop processors: where my 6600k has 10mb total, the cheapest threadripper ($450) has 40mb and the most expensive threadripper ($1500) has *80mb*. the fact that these processors come with 12-36 cores doesn't help at all, but the large caches mean that, effectively, the origin and destination of data is much closer than from cpu-dram.   


so if things continue at this pace, i think it is likely that cpus and dram will continue to be either unhelpful or even hurtful for df purposes -- but it might not matter if sram/cache continues to grow in size and decrease in cost. it might be possible that in 5 years, new cpus might be able to eliminate *any* df fps death due to cache size alone, even without any optimization on toady's part whatsoever. after all, as i said in the beginning, dram speeds haven't increased in over a decade -- so as toady has been adding more and more systems, there hasn't really been an increase in our computer's power to help deal with those systems because the extra cores and extra ram didn't address df's issues. but sram, i am hopeful, might do just that.

167,"mine was a fort i built a couple of years ago into a mountain.
i had built it in 3 floors.
the first was ground level. in the second i had built a bridge that if lowered would let attackers fall into a pit filled with water, crocodiles and some vampires ( i have no idea how 2 vampires managed to get in there). on the 3rd and final floor i had built a trap that if activated would let a lot of water down to the attackers, slowing them down or if they were light enough seeping them off the path in an abandoned mineshaft. long story short, one day a bunch of goblins attacked. i sent my warriors up to the 2nd floor and my workers at the end of the 3rd floor. they killed nearly all of my soldiers so i activated the first trap killing nearly all of them. the remaining goblins sadly killed the remaining military and headed down to the 3rd floor. not wanting to risk the life of my worker dwarfs i activated my second trap.
i was quite new to the game at this point so my traps were pretty badly designed, so somehow the water sources of my 2 traps connected. 
so when i activated the trap the vamires, the goblins who were trapped inside the pit and  the crocodiles all came washed down from the ceiling. after a quick fight between vampires and goblins. the vampirified goblins attacked my hopeless dwarfen workers and my queen leaving them either dead or also as vampires."

3- i do not like at all how the smoothed floors look, it reminds me of my old bathroom, with the small square tiles.

&amp;#x200b;

for this i would like to know if there is any easy way to change the tiles of walls by another tileset such as spacefox.

&amp;#x200b;

i have tried to use tilegenie but they get out of the edit box.

&amp;#x200b;

thanks for the help!

ps: with the above i do not want to underestimate the work, it's an incredible tileset."

185,"back in 2016, i started my first campaign of df. i had a pretty successful first run but was forced to stop playing when i had to move states. i came across this file recently and remember how amazed i was reading through the game generated history. i spent an evening or two (back in 2016) making the below story. all i altered was a bit of added story line to connect things up. 95% of the below was df generated. i thought i would share in hopes to see others post their first history / story df game. i do wonder what ever became of the muscleglazes.

history:

in the realm of the cyclopean plane, the dwarves of the invisible paddle is a civilization forged from the ice of the north.  resilient beings capable of weathering harsh conditions and surviving long battles.  in year 1, 366 dwarfs known as the squeezing lenses founded the civilization of the invisible paddles. they were led by the queen olin tourmighty. she was a dwarf born in -61 who was known for her great ""judging intent.""  she was elected to be the first leader of the invisible paddles.  they were not alone in this region for they were surrounded by the 3 other civilizations; the goblins of the north called the sick dungeon, the humans to the south east called the domestic kingdoms, and the humans to the south west called the the yellow relm.

[https://i.imgur.com/pvofbho.png](https://i.imgur.com/pvofbho.png)

the invisible paddles lived in peace until the early winter of year 15. to the north there was a settlement of goblins. the invisible paddles opened their eyes to the plan that these devilish creatures were creating.  in early history the goblins wondered the wasteland and open tundra in search for nothing more than food and shelter from the harsh blizzards.  they spawned from the depths of the earth, just like the dwarfs to the south, though less fortunate.  for they were surrounded by nothing but snow and ice unlike the dwarfs.  for the dwarfs were on the edge of the tundra.  they thrived in the warmer more fertile land.   the goblins new this, they knew the dwarfs turned their back to the barren land.  while the dwarfs were thriving the goblins were struggling.   but true to their nature, the goblins would soon change that.  their settlement was to the north of the dwarfs.  they knew if they attacked the dwarfs early they could gain the upper hand.  but an unexpected event happened in year 11.  the dwarf unib strikentheaters made a journey to the depths of the world where he found evidence that the goblins to the north were preparing for war.  he heard whispers in the caves about jealousy and hatred.   

after his return in mid-spring, he reported his findings to the queen.  queen olin prayed to her deity called rall the god of diamonds and turquoise for guidance.  true to her being, she would meet the goblins before they had the chance to attack.  not only was she great in judgment but she was also great in intimidation and that was her plan.  to force to goblins back to their holes and show them the dwarfs were the keepers of this land.  after three years of preparation, she appointed unib to lead the battle against the goblins. thus the 85 yearlong battle of the dented conflict was waged against the goblin's who called themselves the cruelties of escorting.

after many years of battling and over 260 deaths, the dwarfs could no longer remember the feeling of peace.  many of their resources were spent in waging war.  this divided the dwarfs.  some said, ""end the war and return to the homeland. let the goblins freeze in the cold.""  others said the queen fabricated the story and that unib never left his home let alone heard of war.  but no one will ever know for the queen went to her death bead, in year 88, knowing the truth.   king oddom yellsstandards was queen olins son who was the rightful heir to the thorn.  he was intent on seeing out his mother’s dreams of defeating the goblins to the north.  and the great general unib never regained his memory after he suffered a blow to the head in the battle against stasost the goblin in year 60.   

a small band of dwarfs numbering 7, wanted nothing to do with the war.  they were tired of rumors, tiered of the constant arguments that consumed the elders.  they want to see rivers of gold and magnificent treasures created by its people.  so on year 100, the 7 dwarf who call themselves thumfikod (muscleglazes) set off in search of new land.  some place untouched by war and away from the humans that closed in around them.  

expedition leader zuglar limuligath set his compass to the south and led our group of 7 towards a bright future.  the trip was not easy for they had to travel over the ocean separating their old land and the new.  through the ""terrifying forest"" and over the ""unknown mountains.""  finally after a long journey, they laid eyes on the area they would call home for the first time.  an area warm and shielded from the harsh storms by the mountains to their north and west.  here the land is rich with ore and sounded by the untamed wilderness.

187,"i just detected this in a recent scan.

trojan.swrort in the dwarf mockup utility.

i found it in both an older version and the current (0.44.12) versions of the lnp.  if anyone else has some information to share i was going to look further into this.

edit: feel free to decide for yourselves. i was just trying to find some more information about this topic. i appreciate all the downvotes and feedback from what i thought was an extremely friendly community.
regardless of the results i will be leaving this here for anyone else who was concerned. 

also, i wanted to address the fact that the creator mentioned it was a false positive for a specific antivirus program.  in the [virustotal scan](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6e126556a8560f36d7883d42bb3607b24b733e321cb35f70fe3238956c2e59ea/detection) that i did, avira marked it as clean. malwarebytes detects this as a trojan and it has a 60% malicious confidence from crowdstrike. the tr/dropper.gen7 detection is an old detection and seems to be sufficiently cleaned since then.  there now is a variety of [new detected variants.](https://i.imgur.com/ng4byc4.png) again to conclude, i am not saying that there is anything inherently wrong with the dwarfmockup utility, just that there is a non-zero chance that it contains a virus. here is the [hybrid-analysis results](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/6e126556a8560f36d7883d42bb3607b24b733e321cb35f70fe3238956c2e59ea) if anyone else would like to double-check anything i have mentioned."
188,"now, i'll be the first to admit that the acoustic composition that plays on an endless loop in dwarf fortress is the pinnacle of musical achievement and will not ever be surpassed by anyone in this lifetime or the next, and that there is no real need to listen to anything else, ever, but also that sometimes you just want to switch things up. what kind of music do you listen to while launching cattle off the top of your fortress and digging ditches to have them land in?"
189,"okay, so, first of all, i haven't been playing dorf for more than a month, i'm not familiar with all the little intricacies yet. that said, i've been a long time fan of a particular webserial called [a practical guide to evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/), and in a recent chapter an underground drow city was described which i just cannot *not* at least try to build because it both fits so well and is just amazing in general. here's how it's described:

&gt;great lotow was built in levels, that was the easiest way to describe it. the heart of the city was a massive pit with a spire of stone in the centre, from base to summit large as a small fortress. from that tree radiates branch-like bridges leading to districts carved directly into the rock across the chasm, their sizes variable. closer to the bottom i could glimpse districts large as summerholm itself serving as farms and lakes, while closer to the centre the holes in the rock were more like neighbourhoods of carved houses. at its peak, i thought, lotow must have had several hundred thousand drow living in it. now, though, most of it was abandoned. some of the bridges linking the spire to the sides had been broken and though some were replaced by rope bridges made of some kind of pale weed many more had simply been left gaping, the districts they led to now empty ruins.  
&gt;  
&gt;it was a moving sight, i would admit. the structure of the city alone would have been impressive, but the ancient drow had made of lotow a work of art. there was hardly a wall or floor that was not filled by a mosaic or bas-relief, stalactites and stalagmites had been carved into painted statues of drow and animals. entire spans of ceiling had been set with coloured stones and gems to create a sky, and there were tall steles showing spindly sentences in crepuscular reciting old stories and ballads where my people would have placed street signs instead. ivah had told me that last detail was an old drow custom: streets had once been known by the never-mentioned titles of the written work on the stele, every drow expected to be well-taught enough to know it at a glance.  
&gt;  
&gt;now, though, those old stories were painted over with blood red runes to mark where territories began and ended. metal and precious stones had been ripped out of statues and mosaics, carvings older than callow left to erode under the depredations of elements and time. stone houses that collapsed were not raised anew but covered with skins and leathers as half-tents while ancient temples and mansions lay cracked open, their heavy stones used to make walls of piled rock. and still, after centuries and millennia, great lotow endured. long winding aqueducts rival to any of miezan make descended along the sides of the pit and provided water to cisterns and fountains, sewers unlike i’d ever seen sent filth towards the lower farms without overflowing or clogging after what must have been centuries of disrepair. there was no city like this in callow, i thought. not even in praes, who had been under miezan occupation and so benefitted from that empire’s fondness for great civil works. great lotow would have been the crown jewel of any surface nation, the envy of the continent.  
&gt;  
&gt;down here, it was just one more decaying corpse in the pile. it was a sorrowful sort of awe that i felt. *would we have raised cities like this, if we were not always at war?* i wondered. callow had little to boast of save for cathedrals and fortresses. the bridges linking summerholm were a wonder, to be sure, but a miezan one. sometimes i could see why the rest of calernia called us backwards peasants. we were so much less than we could have been. praes too, i thought. there was so much potential in the empire, if it would just cease devouring itself every other decade. so much knowledge and skill, always turned to acts of self-immolation that took chunks of the continent along with it.

now, i have some ideas on how to start. digcircle in dfhack for the central spire, multi-level rock bridges, the spire can be walled up with drawbridges, that kind of stuff. i'll redirect a river early on to flood the farm levels, and use it as waterfalls afterwards, maybe some nice in-city rivers while we're at it. i was thinking of making each city block self-sufficient in everything except food, with actual houses on separate (channeled) levels with workshops on the ground floor and bedrooms, dining rooms and personal storage on the second, with workshop resources arriving through an extensive automated minecart system in central stockpiles, and raw food arriving from the farms to be cooked at higher levels.

the problem is, i don't know how to properly design those city blocks. ho do i efficiently do that? what do i put where? how do i get any basics done without my dwarves rioting? i need to engrave a lot of stuff, so i'll only have one chance in the digging department as well, and if each city block is self-sufficient what can i possibly use the central spire for?

basically i'm looking for ideas on proper design and development (not gonna start until i finish cptnduck's tutorials, so i might learn something there), and on how to not fuck up too badly. tl;dr noob needs advice on first megaproject. it's quite daunting."
190,"this is made even more astonishing by it being, essentially, an easter egg. i noticed my dwarves performing a dance routine and decided to view (j)ob details in the (u)nit list. i think it would actually be possible to recreate this dance from these details.

###   play åm  
 the dance has reached the point where its accompaniment is at a verse and a chorus.  
the pristine dessert is a social group dance originating in the high pillar.  
the form guides dancers during improvised performances.  the dance is accompanied by any composition of the rhyme of playing.  

the dancers perform in a double circle, moving to the music's osed rhythm.  this dance is a refined artform, with four specific moves to be mastered.  the twisting calm relaxed dance is punctuated by powerful hand gestures.  the dance enters a new section with the chorus of the music. the dancers perform very slowly with the music.  this section is punctuated by clockwise quarter turns.  

the nural is one of the fundamental dance moves.  there is a low body level with understated independent body movement, a partially realized raised right arm and a leftward bend mirrored by group members.  

the bugsud is one of the fundamental dance moves.  first, there is a sprightly spin with a raised arm and delicate independent body movement performed in retrograde by group members.  then there is a right kick.  finally, there is a rightward bend with a delicate arm carriage and a high spin.  

the okag is one of the fundamental dance moves.  there is a leap with a spin performed in retrograde by group members and an undulating hand gesture.  the nazush is one of the fundamental dance moves.  there is a body level change with an undulating arm carriage and a fluid backward bend.    

the rhyme of playing is a form of music used for entertainment originating in the high pillar.  the rules of the form are applied by composers to produce individual pieces of music which can be performed.  the music is played on a åm.  the entire performance is to be in whispered undertones.  the melody has long phrases throughout the form.  it is performed in the osed rhythm.  throughout, when possible, composers and performers are to alternate tension and repose.  the åm always does the main melody.  

the rhyme of playing has the following structure: a verse and a lengthy chorus.  the verse should feel mournful and accelerates as it proceeds.  this passage typically has some sparse chords.  the passage is performed using the tosid scale.  the chorus should bring a sense of motion and is very slow.  only one pitch is ever played at a time in this passage.  the passage is performed using the berim scale.  scales are constructed from twenty-four notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.  the tonic note is fixed only at the time of performance.  

the tosid hexatonic scale is thought of as joined chords spanning a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth.  these chords are named mabdug and emär.  the mabdug tetrachord is the 1st, the 5th, the 8th and the 15th degrees of the quartertone octave scale.  the emär tetrachord is the 15th, the 21st, the 22nd and the 25th (completing the octave) degrees of the quartertone octave scale.  

the berim pentatonic scale is thought of as joined chords spanning a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth.  these chords are named bidok and emär.  

the bidok trichord is the 1st, the 9th and the 15th degrees of the quartertone octave scale.  the osed rhythm is made from two patterns: the uvel (considered the primary) and the nokzam.  the patterns are to be played in the same beat, allowing one to repeat before the other is concluded.  

the uvel rhythm is a single line with twenty-four beats divided into eight bars in a 3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3 pattern.  the beat is stressed as follows:

| x - x | - x - | x x - | x x x | x x ! | x - x | - x - | x x - |

where ! marks the primary accent, x marks an accented beat, x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  the nokzam rhythm is a single line with two beats.  the beats are named emuth (spoken em) and fer (fe).  

the beat is stressed as follows:| x - | where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.   "

192,"so, i installed dwarf fortress about a week ago. i've known about the game for a long time but a friend finally managed to get me to play it. naturally, i followed the quickstart guide and used the newb pack.

so, i generate a world and set off on an expedition! i start digging after getting used to some controls. and i channelled too much because i'm an idiot, so my two miners got stuck down a hole and died. rip dorfs, you never lived.

now that i was used to the game and designating, i decided to give it an actual go!

this time i made sure to actually not get people trapped in a hole. things started out rather smoothly, i set some early engraving on my fortress and basically dug until i hit a cavern. then i stopped digging and just started making stuff.

an elf caravan appeared on the map! i had a depot, i was ready to trade...

and i completely ignored them because i was still too much of a newb to know how to trade.

now, my fortress was... well... it was nice.

a big 3x3 staircase down about 8 layers. a kitchen, a workshop/storage, a forge, a engraving site-turned mausoleum, the living quarters... everything a dwarf could ever want.

nobles weren't much of a problem! turns out that engraving literally everything and making all furniture out of gold keeps people happy.

but... that gold is the start of my downfall.

i had built some early traps in the main entryway, but i had no weapons or armour. i dug and i dug and i dug, past the cavern and another cavern and etc. and there was not a single bit of ore. i was stuck with gold and gems. (igneous intrusive?)

my wealth attracted more dorfs, yet i still was limited to just a few bits of wood for some training spears. well, and maybe a few items i was able to buy after eventually learning how to do things.

i finally build my military after about 75 dorfs. they're training, they're having a good time... so, i decide to go ""hey, how about we go raid that nearby goblin camp"".

may armok guide you, squad. you set out and were never heard from again, not in a million years (okay about 1.5). 'a short trip' but you never stopped travelling.

actually i think there's a glitch when you send out a noble (militia commander). the game doesn't let the noble leave to go raid or something. i don't know how. there are two effects to this glitch:

1. i was without my military, seemingly forever.

2. barely a week later, i got sieged.

i was told that the first siege would be easy. that it would be a simple affair, handled by a few traps. this is far from the truth. the reality is, the siege was chaos. the traps all missed.

i looked up how to make a military squad and basically sent suicide dwarves at each goblin. 7 goblins, 70 dwarves... by the time the siege was done, my halls were red and i had half that number.

...how do i equip my squads with weapons, actually? i had some lying around and even my training spears were probably better than barehanded combat.

we survived, despite my inexperience. fortunately i had a full hospital and a good number of doctors. also now i had red stairs, which was cool.

after getting the fort back to normal, well relatively normal, i started building up a new guard force (seemingly all wrestlers?) and things started looking up!

and then another siege happened. 50 goblins, if not more.

the fort was doomed. my bridge was built but the lever was still unconnected. i knew this would be my doom, so i sent the forces bravely into the fray. the swordsdwarf who was visiting to slay monsters ended up joining the fight and died.

rest in peace, fath. you slayed a forgotten beast in worldgen, you slayed dozens of monsters in the caverns, yet you were butchered by a few cowardly goblins and their trolls.

my dwarves were hunted down and slaughtered to the last. the only survivor at first was a visiting human bard in my tavern, who soon perished like the rest. i had nothing.

...but it wasn't over?

i got this screen: https://i.imgur.com/jgvuo2h.png

i'm not sympathising for this monster. the siege was ongoing. i think some of the goblins were falling victim to the caverns? i had nothing left, not even non-wild animals. what was going on?

...well, it turns out that my raiding party (who at this point had been gone for a year) counted as being alive. so, the fortress could never truly end.

elves came with their caravans. a wereskunk attacked. the elves struck it down? what was happening???

eventually a band of 20 new migrants arrived. they found the remaining 3 trolls and ended them, ending the siege. the fortress would live once again.

...kinda.

after letting them clear up, not even setting any labours, i decided that it had been a good run. a megabeast appeared, but i just cut down my stairs to the caverns and let them roam down there. i had a few burial coffins and stuff, but i wouldn't need them anymore.

i retired my fortress not long afterwards.

may the banner-gates of beer and the fort of hammermyth go down in history. as what? who knows? some damn idiot and their mismanaged fortress.

i think i'll embark again soon."

the symbol shows a chicken, goblins, elves, humans, and a four pointed star. the chicken is striking a menacing pose. the four pointed star is striking a triumphant pose. the goblins are screaming. the elves are screaming. the humans are screaming.

can you guess what the goal is? (hint: i've got goblins, humans, and elves really, really, really close by and deliberately picked it for that reason) oh, and the civ name is ""the oil of targets"". plenty of targets. muwahahahahahhaha!"
199,"so i’m very new to dwarf fortress. last week i did a very brief attempt at a fortress that quickly collapsed as i did not have enough food. however i did get a good basic sense of how civilizations function and work. 

on my next attempt at a fortress, which has so far been successful, surviving it’s first two years, i have noticed that the only news i have received on the world screen was the appointment of a new king. i could not find another dwarf hold of my civilization (there are plenty of other dwarf civilizations though.) neither dwarf caravan came with an outpost liaison. 

after two years my civilization started to get offsite nobles other then the king, but i still don’t know how to check it there is another hold of my civilization. this leads me to ask two noob question: what challenges will i face basically being the last of my civilization for the time being?
in the legends i learned that the main fortress of my civilization was conquered 80 years ago by the disgusting elves. how can i find the conquered hold and what will be needed to take it back? "
200,"i recently suffered a 'soft' loyalty cascade at my fort (more later) and managed to 'fix' it by retiring my fortress and then unretiring it immediately. it appears that resets your dwarves to have default loyalties. however, see below for a description of my situation, and why it might not apply to a full-blown loyalty cascade.

&amp;#x200b;

for those who don't know, a loyalty cascade happens when one or more of your dwarves gets marked as an enemy of the parent civilization. your other dwarves attempt to kill him, which (since he is still part of the parent civilization, too) marks them as enemies of your civ (and yet still part of your civ), and then these conflicted loyalties spread like wildfire through your fort. from my googling, it appears to happen most when you kill the outpost liason or sometimes when accidentally releasing goblins (who then go kill someone, and it gets blamed on the dwarf who let him out).

&amp;#x200b;

this leads to all kinds of fun and usually a fortress death that's even faster and gorier than a tantrum spiral.

&amp;#x200b;

in my particular case, i never touched goblins (too early to have attacks) or the outpost liason. (funnily enough, however, he is a goblin - which might be the source of the problem.) my dwarves also never tried to kill one another, but they were constantly interrupting each other and running away from one another.

&amp;#x200b;

be aware that if you retire your fortress, when you reclaim it all your configuration options (except hotkeys and possibly routes) are lost. you need to reset your workshop orders and profiles, reconfigure your manager queue, and re-designate everything. areas are conserved, but i've discovered that at least sometimes rooms created from furniture, while still extant and assigned to a given dwarf, do not fulfill that dwarf's requirements (for nobles)."
201,"so, my three-year old (game time) fortress managed to somehow bypass all the caverns and magma while inadvertently opening the fun place. i am currently one lever pull away from disaster. but, i think there is opportunity here. i'm looking for any especially interesting solutions to a hallway full of clowns... help? bear in mind that i'm relatively new to the game and the end-mode."
202,"inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/8hlg6r/stackable_60_bedroom_layout_with_previews_and/) i created a 125-bedroom macro on a very similar pattern. the primary differences are using a 3x3 staircase and hallways rather than 2x2, and so of course more (and occasionally larger) bedrooms.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

[125 bedrooms, plus noble\/dining\/storage\/hospital rooms. note the forgotten connection of the 1-way hallway to the northwestern medium-size room, and the extra connections on the western corner bedrooms.](https://i.redd.it/udiy47ncmks11.png)

&amp;#x200b;

pastebin of the macro [here](https://pastebin.com/024y2kj1). in case you don't know, you can save macros under your dwarffortress directory in \~/data/init/macros as a \*.mak file and then in the game load it with \^l (ctrl-l for those on windows), then hit \^p to start pasting. this macro starts in the upper left corner of the 3x3 staircase.

also, please note that i did absolutely nothing to optimize this macro, so it will take some time to run, and do all kinds of silly things like wandering around the map (within the dimensions of the marked space), go back over areas already touched, that kind of thing. also, i forgot one connection and included 2 accidentals, which you can see in the image.

this macro works in an area of 84(tall)x86(wide). for best results, start with the designation tool already set to 'dig'. despite the picture above, this macro will designate the up/down stairs itself.

the central area is 15x13. the large rooms are 10x10. the smaller large rooms are 7x7. most of the other rooms are 2x3, though eight are 5 tiles and four are 10 tiles.

i have exactly zero interest in fixing this, though if someone wants to, feel free. post your results and tag me, too, so i can use the new one."
203,they were just getting a beer. lazy bums.
204,"my fortress, the under-hall, has passed its initial survivability point. about sixty dwarves, housed in a nice wooden inn above ground, with a decent metal and clay industry, and food security. a nearby tower nearly wiped us out in year one, but strangely hasn't bothered us for some time. the first caverns are breached and the downstairs entrance reasonably secure. the cavern area is nice, open, and reasonably flat, but short on water. we have a small, semi-effective military that is currently being outfitted better (using orichalcum, a custom metal similar to steel. we don't have iron here that i've found yet). our defenses are meager, relying primarily on closing the doors and yelling insults from the windows of the inn. we have rudimentary beginnings of most industries, and a surprisingly well stocked library. water is looking like a bit of a problem so far.

of note, i've decided to avoid massive walls of single tile traps, although i do use them in small numbers in strategic hallways. i tweaked the stress response of my dwarves a bit, and also i have a few custom reactions allowing me to make stone blocks of any colour for construction, and more clay furniture. other than that it's a pretty raw game. i think i also gave goblins access to steel, and elves access to iron. we have yet to see how that pans out, or even if it worked. i have weather turned off currently for framerate reasons and because i like outdoor building and the constant bad thoughts are just too prohibitive. if the project allows it i will reactivate the rain.

what shall i build here? our setting is a flat, heavily wooded subtropical area with no river, just swamp. i would like to make this some sort of combination of an above ground (the over-hall) and below ground (the under-hall) fortress, but i haven't yet decided how. a frequent fascination of mine is building a proper city with roads and buildings... but i'm not sure how i'd like to set that up. anyone have any ideas, or a good inspiration you've seen? if reddit decides the project, i'll post pictures of its progress.

(side note: i'm also open to the idea of bringing an adventurer or ten, of a single species, to the fortress to mess with things. i was considering the idea of retiring some moose men here, after bringing them in to write some books. so far i haven't been able to survive the trip, thanks to nearby evil biomes and necromancers. i love the idea of a moose man squad equipped with custom fitted armour.)

---

 update: i've decided to go with some suggestions here, and build a surface city where my wood and farming industries are kept, and an undercity where metal and stone are. while i do the layout on that, i'll also leave room to see if i can build a lovely fountain in the town square above... a project made tricky by the current lack of replenishing water. still, if i can fill a cistern i might be able to get it to work using what i've got available."
205,"i’ve experimented with marcos and really love them. i’d like to type out some of my own instead of just recording them. is there a way to clean up the macros and make them just have the information i need? i seem to have a lot of background information that happens aside from designating stone. 

eventually i’d like to get to the point where i can have a macro that sets up an industry for me. something simple like building a stockpile next to it having a crafts workshop and make stone pots from it. with work orders set to produce after the stock gets low.

has anyone been successful writing their own macros?"
206,"pretty much that. i find it disappointing i can have a top level cpu and gpu, yet play lowering the 4x4 starting grid to 2x2, and still have to optimise my builds and strategy to limit my fps plummeting"

209,"so i havent played a whole lot however through my forts i've probably slain about 15-20 forgottenbeasts, and usually there is no trouble, heck the worst syndrome i rolled jusy made my dwarves bleed periodically... nonlethally for life( nice blood trails whenever the squads moved out).
 but today i fought a webspitting scorpionfly with an early military of about 20 dwarves and lost 10, including my most elite fighters(three had gotten around 11, no legendary). it was hellishly fast, felt no pain, and unlike gcs's had enough strength to break the neck of any dwarf it webbed. my dwarfs mostly had silver maces and after crushing much of its body one finally smashed it's head. 
well i thought some terrible disease would be the death of my squads so this was a surprise. guess my decense plan for the next few years it to quickly construct some clever traps above and below ground because my surviving dwarfs probably can't hold the line against the goblins next year."
210,"not sure if what i did was a fluke or if this is an effective strategy to counter werebeasts, but in my fortress the first external threat was a were-llama. i rushed everyone inside the fort and assembled my militia to hold the gate. i changed the permissions for the door to forbid passage and had it closed tight.

contrary to my expectations the were-llama did not break down the door. it only killed some creatures left outside and knocked over my hives. when the sun rose. it transformed into a goblin which was easily disposed of.

i don’t know how well this works in other attempts. but at least from my one experience, outlasting a were-beast might be the safest strategy in handling them.  "
211,"yes! ctrl + a will export all maps. all xmls, everything you need!

(it requires df-hack)"
212,"so, uh. i had a weretapir attack an elf. tore that little elf to pieces. somehow in the fighting, or just after, it took the elf's jute head veil, put it on, and. uhh. it doesn't seem to be biting anymore. breaking bones, sure. but biting? i. i don't think it is.

can a werebeast wearing a veil or something else covering its mouth bite? 

if no, is this a known feature? a bug?

... should i leave head veils soaked in blood around my fortress in the hopes that werecreatures put them on?

edit: definitely said the werebeast _hit_ the target with the veil. werebeast was wearing veil on head. did, in the end, wind up with weretapir infections - possibly from a 'hit' that caused an ear to explode. all the hits i saw were bruises. "

214,are there any dwarfy podcasts? don't have a ton of time to play these days but i'd love to tune in to something like a podcast. anyone got any recs?
215,"for those who only play fortress mode, df has a second mode: adventure. the premise is that you create a single character and run around recruiting companions and slaying evil stuff like dragons, trolls, and people who suggest rimworld when you want an alternative to df adventure mode (not that rimworld is bad, it just gets annoying when that's all you can find on the internet).

here's the problem: the world is rather unresponsive to the player's actions in some very obvious ways. if i'm wrong tell me.

here's an idea on how to address the issue.

step one: add guard npcs to each town. they just do a beat, though they might be distractible in later updates.

step two: break apart fame to where you have a reputation with each individual civ. doing things that favor a civ increase your fame when you spread the word. however, if you're caught walking out with someone's stuff or slaughtering people, a value called infamy increases. infamy causes ambushes just like fame, but you can reduce the likelihood that you will get caught by changing a costume and going to another town. simple stuff."

218,"shrinestandards was a disaster the moment it began. the embark looked good on the overworld map, but upon arrival there wasn't a singe pond to be had, save a 2x1 puddle of stagnant water. no worries, i thought, i'll just dig down to the caverns for water. i never found the caverns. accepting that water would be scarce, i began a near-surface plump helmet farm and was beginning to get back on track, when of all things a were-monitor lizard shows up, kills three dwarves, and bites five others.

it was out of control from there. depression, dehydration, and tantrums abounded. i eventually locked the last four were-monitors in a room (the fifth died), and tried to salvage things with the newest migrant wave, but to no avail. every last dwarf died except the final were-monitor, stuck in a walled-off room. at this point, i decided things were beyond salvaging, and abandoned the fort to ruin.

at least it was fun!"
219,"so, i've been doing a bit of science.

as we all know by now, raiding is a bit buggy.  between [dwarves spending 3 in-game years traveling cause one dog was chained up](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/7gft7v/day_658_my_squad_of_10_raiders_are_still/), to [dwarves getting stuck looking for relics not located at a civilized site](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=10545), there has been quite a lot of hair pulling and tantruming over bugs that ruin an otherwise amazing expansion to this game.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm not here with a solution to these bugs, but instead i've found another bug variant:

[https://imgur.com/a/zcnfrqr](https://imgur.com/a/zcnfrqr)

as you can see, once the dwarf in the third position leaves the map, she is replaced by another random dwarf.  this new dwarf has never been present in the current fort, and the raid never ends up progressing, similar to how raids will not leave the map until all members have left the map.  despite all 10 originally assigned dwarves having left the map, this new assignment causes the raid to never occur, trapping the soldiers in limbo.  i have repeated the experiment by placing githa in a different squad and position (though i failed to take screenshots); on leaving the map, she was replaced with the same dwarf, and again the raid was lost to the void.  the same issue occurred when a different dwarf (vicu nememsheni, mercenary) was assigned to the third position of the original squad; they were replaced by a dwarf not present at the fort, though the new dwarf was different than in the original case.

&amp;#x200b;

as best as i can tell, some dwarves with a preassigned title (poet, mercenary, etc) cause this bug to occur.  i have only been able to produce it with two dwarves thus far.  the only certain fix i have found is to remove any dwarf from that position.  while i have not had the time to test this bug more at the time of this post, i will update it later when i have tested it more.

&amp;#x200b;

if anyone else would like to test this bug, i have added a copy of the save here:

[bugged save can be downloaded here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uan56s835qx2462/aabj4mspv7s4ka1uxbc6stg4a?dl=0)

&amp;#x200b;

edit:

replacing githa with a normal, untitled dwarf (ineth tulonbatok, axe lord) causes the raid to proceed without issue.  however, it was discovered that position 5 was actually a different dwarf than listed in earlier screenshots: zulur rathegobol took on the name rakust osuzol during the mission, refuting the theory that this is specifically caused by a dwarf arriving with a title.  instead, it is possible that the name change may interfere with pets: githa has two war dogs assigned to her; during the initial test, the war dogs were reassigned to the new name, but did not leave the map.  zulur, however, has no war dogs assigned to him, and thus no problems occurred.  what exactly causes dwarves to adopt a new name is unclear, but i have only noticed it with titled dwarves."

222,"as you probably already know, dwarf fortress can be a cpu-intensive game at times, particularly when running a large fortress or when generating a large world.

my computer's cpu is an intel core i7-6700k @ 4.00ghz. it is quad-core, with two logical cores per physical core, so it essentially has eight cores. [it also has a passmark score of 11,112](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=intel+core+i7-6700k+%40+4.00ghz&amp;id=2565). so it should be able to run dwarf fortress better than well, right?

well, i recently discovered that dwarf fortress [only uses one cpu core at a time!](https://i.imgur.com/t1izpw1.png)

i understand that the df came out in 2006. back then a lot of computers still only had one or two cores. but nowadays i don't know of any processor on the market that has only one core. if df used all eight of my cores, world generation would be sped up greatly, especially since it takes quite a long time (large worlds with long histories can take hours).

what is your opinion on this matter, and could this issue be potentially fixed in a future update?"
223,as i've told people on bay 12 i've decided to end archcrystal at year 500 which is in about 60 years (6 months time roughly). i've started writing the ending but it's fluid of course depending on what happens. is there anything that any of you would like to see in its conclusion? specifically taking names for dwarves in the final (one word only) and maybe events you'd like to see them in. can't promise everything but giving back to the community in terms of seeing them as players in the script would be very rewarding. so if you have any suggestions i'd love to take them now.
224,"the dwarves of the ageless workers set out in a moderately savage forest, expecting trouble from the nearby goblin pits. they immediately set to felling trees and building a pleasant little log tavern while the miners got busy digging towards ore. things were going quite well, and we were nearly prepared to start building armour when winter of our first year came.

winter came, and on the very first day of moonstone, it came not with goblins, but with undead. a vast horde, outnumbering not just our ill-equipped warriors but our entire fort. led by *two* necromancers.

we stood no chance of fighting this horde, so we did the only thing we could do. we locked the doors of our tavern and hoped they'd see the futility and leave.

as the zombies scratched and gnawed at the doors of our log cabin in the haunted woods (to no avail; dwarven craftsmanship and all), screaming came from the cellar. we had forgotten one thing: the refuse pile in the basement. the zombies outside were contained, but now the horde was crawling up from beneath...

they were swifty dispatched, but the completely classic horror movie buildup was awesome."
225,"my most recent fort has been cruising along without much in the way of tragedy, yet. only two deaths up to this point, one from old age, and the other from a weremoose, despite multiple sieges from elves, goblins, and humans. 

then we discovered adamantine, which was a little odd because i hadn't been doing any additional mining at the moment. turns out two of my dwarves were sparring, and charged themselves through the wall of the volcano into the magma, falling into the magma sea where they discovered adamantine, somehow reporting it back to the rest of the fort.

231,"if i raise my bridge, i win siege. how is this balanced?"
232,"i genned this world and immediately noticed that the goblins were on their own island separated from the mainland by a small isthmus. i decided to plop down a fort across the isthmus to see if i could initiate contact with the goblins, and maybe initiate contact between the goblins and the humans (maybe if the goblins attack during a human caravan, or something) 

my dwarven civilization has fallen, and the dwarves were almost extinct (there were 7 unnamed dwarves living in random human towns, i like to imagine these guys suddenly decided to get together and start the fortress)

the elves still have a civilization populated by the only living elf, who is also living in a random human tomb for some reason (must be an introvert) 

with all that said, my fort has been going for a good 3 years now, and the humans come to trade, but the goblins still don't know about me. so i guess i'll have to poke them with a raid at some point. i just want to know if anything like this has been attempted by anyone yet? if so, i'd love to hear about it! 

edit: here's an image of the world map for all those interested: https://imgur.com/a/wmyxpcl

update: the goblins have finally laid siege. 114 goblins with no mounts. no kidnapped leaders presumably because they didn't know about any other species until now."
233,i'm just too invested in how much time i spent learning it to stop.
234,"i was thinking of doing this idea on my fort, a coliseum for goblins where they will fight bears and other wild animals. but my only problem is how would i accomplish that ? i am not sure how to capture the goblins, as for the coliseum the plan was pretty simple. a square arena and a jail room for the goblins on one side and in the opposite side a room for the animals   


once the goblins are set to go i would free them and let them duck it out with the bears. i've never done this before, has any of you had any experience with this that can give a hand  ? "
235,"nearly a century ago, the confederation of murders (humans), the clearing of rock (elves), the dungeon of acting (goblins), the crazed cruelties (goblins), and the ink of lances (dwarves) were founded. in the year 65, the 268-year-old dragon sarvesh firediamond the sweltering furnace was struck down by an unnamed goblin, leading to the passage from the age of three powers to the age of bronze colossus and mountain titan. another 26 years of bitter conflict would follow in the new age.

yet the last war, the scalded scar-conflict between the dwarves and elves, ended just weeks before the turn of the year 92, after the dwarves offered peace. an uneasy worldwide peace was struck...and lasted for perhaps six weeks. the confederation of murders, the most prosperous of the five civilizations with nearly half of the world's population to themselves, lashed out at the crazed cruelties, which is centrally located and had already fought seven wars, and the clearing of rock. a few weeks later, the dungeon of acting, relatively isolated to the northeast and with only two other wars in their history, lashed out at the clearing of rock themselves, leaving the elves to fight a two-front war. meanwhile, a surprisingly incompetent human necromancer lashed out at the clearing of rock by herself, taking nearly a hundred losses with no kills of her own.

in the end, after two years, nine new wars were started, and all nine of them continue a year later. yet none of them involve the ink of lances, a little group of 146 dwarves who seem to prefer craftsdwarfship and trade over war. no surprise: they lost 127 citizens in the world's first war, the war of spikes, 80 years ago, and won 0 battles in the four wars that they've fought since then.

(i thought this was a peculiar, interesting world state, which i jumped into at the start of 92 during the peacetime. i don't have a seed to exactly generate the same world, but i can give my advanced worldgen parameters if you would like them. and my legends file, of course.)"
236,"so i decided to make a pocket world with a short history, high beasts and high savagery, then make a fortress to make masterwork gear for a ""prophesied"" hero that would come and do something based on what's happening/happened in the world. so i take a look at world gen and discover there are no living elves, there is a nomadic group of 11 animated dwarves and 4 animated elves led by a horned owl necromancer, which sounds like fun. what caught my eye and i might try to write a short story about is the current ruler of the dwarves, ilral shootentrance.

ilral was a scout and led the defense of 14 against a goblin army of 218, sadly the dwarves loss. a few months later ilral became the queen of the bell of sculptures. a few things happened from driving off a few beasts, starting a worship the mountain titan izeg sealhollows the rose of irons, and forming a few false friendships. but what i want to delve more into is what happened on 73-02-22, an artifact was named by the wolverine man nisa skewersculpts, after she killed the minotaur loz knifeswords. the artifact is the spy of amethysts was a legendary iron  breastplate, it was lost when nisa died of old age (the ripe old age of 76). 25 years later the dwarf lokum ringreined found the spy of amethysts and gave it to ilral

 while it doesn't sound all that interesting right now i can see a lot of potential for a story here. largely because a few decades before ilral received the artifact she obsessed with her own mortality and sought to extend her life by any means.  


tl;dr: world gen gave me inspiration for a short story based on the dwarf queen."
237,"so i made a new fortress recently, which is located near a waterfall. after a bit of time i had a genius idea:creating a retractable bridge so my dwarves can run from ennemies!
it seemed to be the perfect idea, so i did it.
i placed a burrow on the other side of the bridge and decided to start the test: i ask the lever to be pulled. i forgot 2 things: 1, to activate the burrow. 2, to verify who was gonna pull the lever.
it was my carpenter. and, since the effect is not instant, he was in the middle of the bridge when it retracted. he fell to the bottom of the waterfall and broke his arm. i later saved him with useless floodgates and luck"

so i just wanted to talk about my df experience, for no reason other than i love this game.

so i've know about it probably for decades, only a few years ago however did i decide to lookup a video tutorial series which had over 60 episodes, great fun but still felt overwhelming, as a result i spent quite a long time wanting to play but also being intimidated by the game.

however, i don't really know why exactly but a few weeks ago i started following this guide: [https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and, since it's hands on, i was actually able to finally play the game and understand it (to some extent at least lol).

either way, everything was going fine and dandy, and i had a crappy untrained military (2 squads of 4 melee and 1 of 10 archers), when i was suddenly attacked by a wereelk... by this point i made a fairly large walled area around the entrance of the mountain, both of which had a bridge that could be raised, but since it was the first time something attacked me i figured hey the squads will be plenty (on the tutorial i was attacked by a giant or 2 and a human invasion and i didn't even need to use the kill zone, which wasn't done yet lol).

alas, the wereelk did some damage, i think 2 were dead, 1 was a peasant at least i think which instead of going back to the burrow decided to fight...

anyway some time later another wereelk attacked, a few casualties but it got dieded as well.

fast forward some time and since i was having trouble making soap (never seemed to have oil or tallow and the options were red) i decided to check to see if my hospital had soap in it and when i get there there were ~~blood splatters and corpses everywhere~~ large amounts of fun being distributed by a wereelk because i remembered it's infectious :d

so i decided to just open the floodgates so that the fortress would just flood, which also didn't work since the miners struck a huge cavern hahah.

anyway, 80 dead in minutes.

tl;dr: this game is !!fun!!

ps: still don't quite get how to work with the butchers, tanners, etc

241,"i generated a pocket-sized world recently and embarked in it. when my dwarves arrived, one of them became king in about 2 days, and is demanding royal rooms. apparently the last monarch died, and out of the \~200 dwarves in this civilization, they chose this one. i have to wonder why the king demands royal rooms even in such a tiny fort."

243,"i'm a noob to the game, and decided to keep a log of my first real adventure in adventure mode.  here it is, and please excuse any typos.

 

**day 1**\- after travelling across the lands for almost a full day, requesting for aide from any and all to join me in my travels.  a man has decided to accompany me on adventures.  that man's name is puji tinclobber the hammerdwarf.  he is slim, and of medium stature.  his voice is that of a young child, squeaky and uncertain.  his eyes are of a light olive tint, and he has incredibly narrow ears.  his teeth are rugged, with frequent gaps between them.  he has long, copper, scraggly hair.  he certainly is that of a warrior.  his homeland is of the “glade of ashes.”  i heard from tuma weakcandle, a frail old woman who i presume is puji’s mother, that a vampire by the name of ana lockmansion hides from civilization in the mine of roughness.  he has wreaked havoc on the glade of ashes, and it seemed of great importance to puji that we strike them down.  i feel an obligation to this man to fulfill his wish, as he has bravely chosen to accompany on my journey’s.  i will rest until tomorrow, and will set out southwards to the mine.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

**day 2**\- i awoke before dawn, and waited until the sunrise to head out to the mine of roughness.  it is south from the glade of ashes, near paintedcult, close to my home.  the cowardly creature has been preying on the weak and few of the glade, and fuji and i shall put an end to this freakish, ghastly beast.  the day is almost over, and we now rest near the foot of the “dunes of clarifying”.  the fire is warm, and fuji stays awake, mumbling something about his father.  the journey continues tomorrow.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

**day 3**\- my stomach pains.  i have no clue why.  it hurts.  fuji has brought me water, but it was no help.  it isn’t stopping.  i….. need rest.

**day 5**\-  after sufficient rest, we continue to set out towards the mines.  closer to the rivers this time.  both of us are eager to be moving again.  my log continues when we arrive to our destination.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

**day 8**\- i have arrived at this accursed creatures lair, and now set out to defeat this creature of the night in combat.  may the best man win.  this is maddening!  fuji has been withholding this information, but his father killed the damned beast, and his mother was insane.  i can’t tell if this is true, or he’s using this as an excuse as to why the hellish thing isn’t in its damned lair.  i set out to do other things now.  i will update this logs in the morrows that follow.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo 

**day 11**\- i have arrived at a small homestead on the prairie, and there i have acquired a new follower, in a similar fashion to fuji.  her name is zurko danarosmic the spearwoman.  she has long, gray hair,, with fuse-lobed ears.  she has green eyes, which are far too close together, and with a long, narrow nose.  she is truly that of a warrior.  i have acquired a new mission in this homestead.  there is an army, from my homeland the confederation of bravery, marching across the land to attack showereddevil.  i feel an obligation to aid this army in any way i can.  fuji, zurko, and i now march to said dark fortress, to aid my peoples in the vanquish of this hellish location.  i will update this journal when i arrive, or anything notable happens.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

**day 20**\- i have brought much death on my path to the dark fortress, but i fear today may be my end.  in a scuffle with a crossbowman, i got up close and grabbed his neck and left leg, and hacked away at his chest.  i ignored the pain at firsst , not noticing it, but it appears there is a dagger, deep in my chest.  it has plunged into my right lung, and i have no idea what to do.  my days of adventure may be over.  i will rest in this castle and search treatment.  i will update this log if i live, but if nothing is left, assume the worst.  i will all my belongings to fuji, as he has been my one true friend through these times.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

**day 22**\- after these two days of rest, my lung has stopped bleeding, and zurko has sewn rattlesnake scales upon my lung as a replacement to the muscles there.  i will live, but i feel constantly winded, never able to go at the speeds i used to.  after the dark fortress is cleared, i might consider settling down, building a tavern or something.  who knows, maybe other adventurers will find my tavern, with the same aspirations as i.  i now set out, on my final journey.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

**day 25**\- as i travel around this gulf to the fortress,  i have encountered a region which zurko informs me is known as the “murk of knighting”.  i will tread carefully through these swamps.  the constant buzzing of insects is irritable, and the stench of water is unbearable, but i must continue.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo.

**day 29**\- this damn swamp may be the thing to end me.  i’m running out of water, but it appears there is a river off in the horizon.  by vision has been fuzzy after a horse trampled me, cracking my jaw, but fuji has keen eyes thankfully.  we will continue.

**month 2/day 4-** i have arrived, finally.  i will get a taste of what combat and honour is.  i see corpses of dwarves and humans as we approach, but no sign of an army.  i wonder what mysteries this place hides.  i will continue the journal after some more action has occurred.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo.

**month 2/day 5**\- i am at the foot of the tower, and i expect strong opponents.  here i make a decision.  if i defeat these demons, i will continue my adventure, and if i am overpowered and flee, i will construct a tavern back at the glade, and rest.  may lico bless me this day.

\-hanndo ilpikashmo

this is fuji writing.  we had to flee, and hanndo was swarmed by dogs.  when they left this corpse, all that i saw was arteries and meat.  i tried to tell him to wait for the army, but he refused to listen.  he is now no longer with us.  may lico bless his soul, and may that necromancer burn in armok’s domain.

244,"what i mean by chaotic is layout and aesthetic wise (considering every fortress becomes a clusterfuck of horror eventually). it seems every fort here is designed to be symmetrical and pleasing to the eye, and as efficient as possible.

nah fuck that man. i like fortresses with sprawling, twisting, maze-like layouts, like a massive labyrinth underground that is a nightmare to navigate. like tunnels that lead to nowhere or to areas that have been long abandoned, or massive rooms dedicated as a chamber to hold the tomb of a famous dwarf, and many other examples. i guess i'm inspired by moria and how huge and labyrinthine it is with all the twisting tunnels and chambers. has anyone made forts like this?"
245,without the auto pauses could your fort run without user intervention? 
246,"i don't necessarily mean major mods, although that's fine.

when i start world generation, i usually add a couple things. i make a reaction to powder glass at a quern and use it as enamel in glazing; i double the smelting yields of some low-value metals for practical purposes; and i add a metal called orichalcum that is basically equivalent to steel but made by combining bronze with a rare gem (dwarfstone), so that i am not so reliant on flux.

i also add an evil entity for elves (dark elves) with a mix of elven and goblin ethics.

how about you?"

248,"so, i decided i wanted to experiment with building a sky light into my main hall, to help combat cave sickness, when a minor cave-in occurred, only one z-level up, only one tile of sandy loam, but it was into the main hall, so lots of fun job cancellations due to unconsciousness.

the only two major injuries were a mother and her child, who were both struck by the same piece of siltstone, crushing both of their left legs. dust settles, and i rush to create a hospital (only one year into settlement). the mother was the first taken to the hospital, along with one bruised urist. bizarrely, however, the baby was left behind, ""annoyed after experiencing trauma"" (one tough 3 month old for only being annoyed after losing the ability to walk before its first steps). for the next month, the baby pulled its body and mangled leg around the entrance hall in an aimless circle, between the legs of my busy dwarves and visitors, until his mother returned on her crutch. i do not believe he ever received any care, and i'll be interested to see if he will as a child."
249,"winter drags onward.  olon's life ebbs in the hospital.  the water is frozen; she cannot drink.  spring arrives and olon's life is safe. the mines are being prepared.

life abound in spring; it is fitting that some must be captured for the slaughter.  we construct a new depot to trap the ungrateful for sacrifice.

we hear armok snarl.  we are lax in our fervor and have not spilt enough blood.  we receive our just punishment; the undead have besieged us.

mystifyingly, the necromancer retreats moments later.  perhaps armok has spared us a small sliver of mercy.  no matter, he will return.  we have much blood to spill if we are to survive.

our plan to build tracks has failed; our leader is a fool.  we resort to sweat and muscle to gather stone.  we must hurry; the blood of the langurs has washed away.

ah, fresh zealots arrive.  more muscle for the labor.  to fuel the muscle, we dig out a tavern.  blocks begin to pile up.  soon the foundation shall be laid!"
250,"so i'm building a throne room for my fortress and it's pretty nice. i've got some silver statues of dwarven gods lining the room itself, with a feasting hall preceding it and a gallery above for dwarves to view proceedings. i made a gold throne for my leader to sit upon and ordered it encrusted with gems. our jeweler creates a magnificent display out of our jewels.  

and what subject does my jeweler choose to decorate this magnificent throne? our first dwarves rejecting the leadership of our original expedition leader. the el is weeping from sadness. seems like this dwarf wanted to remind our glorious leader that he is a mere mortal, no greater than any other dwarf in mind or stature.

bloody republican, he should be killed for his impudence "
251,"beginning his adventure in an elven tree city my latest adventurer went off in search of a dangerous rival to slay, and found one, in the creature nuspu xogakumung slonu strobnod, a beast that had been slaying humans and elves since the beginning of time, with it's multiple dagger-like legs. when engaged in battle it quickly crippled my hero's arms, but it's downfall was the immense amount of lucky kicks bas managed to land, eventually slaying the foul beast and ending a terror from the beginning of time. bas was promptly killed by an ambush of a single jaguar.

256,"i don't even go on quests and stuff, i basically turn it into jeffery dahmer's fantasy adventure every time.

i mean any old rpg has quests and shit like that, but this is the only game where you can play as a worm man named manmeat severedtoes who chops off peoples hands just because he can.

or as hammer armsmash the legendary hammer wielding hamster woman who smashes in the skulls of humans many times her size.

or a grizzly bear man who makes it his single goal to bite off and collect the noses of everyone he encounters

and my personal favorite, a dwarf who severs limbs just throw them as his main weapon.

it is autumn.  the liason arrives. we request blood.  only blood.  

a swarm of langurs descends upon the fort. we leave the blood where it lay and tend to the wounded. 

after the slaughter, we begin trade.  our generous offer of goblets is scoffed at; we confiscate their belongings and leave them with nothing.

winter arrives.  ice harvesting begins.  armoks heart is cold; his altar shall reflect this.  tracks are being laid, much stone will be require.  eagerly we await the new year and new crop of zealots.  "
261,"three hours! it took me three hours of tedious designating to get all the way through. i used leonidas' system which he posted on the forums [here.](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169616.msg7695534#msg7695534) that method is apparently a little easier than the double-slit method but by armok does it take a long time! on top of that it leaves an ugly gaping hole. i know the double slit method leaves a smaller hole but it also leaves the corners unwalled which really drives my up the wall (so to speak).

until tarn gets around to updating aquifers or someone comes up with a much more elegant solution, i'm just going to turn them off in the raws. but at least now i can say i did it so i don't have to do it again."
262,"so its been a while since i played dwarf fortress and i had shown a friend of mine to the story of boatmurdered and i got the itch to play again. so i started a grand new fortress called treasurecastles. in 2 years our population was approaching 50, we had food for years thanks to the turkey eggs we had popping out, and was getting our metalworking industry started late but into gear.


then the werebear came.


one dwarf bearly had time to react before he was killed, but the werebear pawsed in the turkey coop until the military arrived. after a short but grizzly battle, one soldier dead, one injured, the werebear was dead. the injured soldier was ushered into a room alone, locked, and sure enough he transformed. what i didn't know was our trader was also injured and just walked it off. four more dwarves dead, and another 6 injured. off they went into their own seperate rooms, and 2 more of them were werebears. well i thought all was well, those 4 non-bears recovered, and i pondered what to do with the remaining 3.


well i didn't have to wonder too long. one of them had a pet cat. the door to his room was somehow accidentally labeled as pet passable, and he got out. into the dining room. during a party. right as the full moon hit. did i mention all our *good* soldiers were either dead or werebears now?


24 dwarves were killed by the time everything came to a halt, 5 injured, one just sat down and cried in a corner until he died of thirst, leaving about 10 functional dwarves, one child, 5 injured, one melancholy. 3 of those injured died in the hospital as the doctor was quite dead, and those 10 remaining dwarves were too busy being distraught and horrified at the grizzly unbearable carnage that was the dining hall.


then a vile force of darkness arrived! they were making their attack slowly, chasing down stray turkeys, and when they finally got to the fortress, i rallied the 10 still functional dwarves, when the full moon hit. the two remaining werebears ripped off their doors, attacked each other, one tore the other to ribbons, then made a beeline for the goblins. once the goblins had killed it, i sent the remaining 10 dwarves in, for a desperate fight for survival.


at the end of it, the fortress' population stood at 4, 2 in hospital, 1 very distraught dwarf, and one child who was *really* happy to have slept in a fine bedroom recently.


and then the immigrants came! 11 immigrants to replenish the fortress, and hopefully save it!"

265,i have a six year long fortress going and more and more of my dwarves are having psychological problems. why? their thoughts are full of the horrors of seeing mangled corpses of horrific creatures. apparently a dwarf's psyche is no more fortified than our own when it comes to these sorts of things. all the swamp whisky and fisherberry wine in the world aren't enough to wash away the vision of an eviscerated hungry head with a silver spear shoved through it's throat or bits of a finely diced flesh ball clinging to a large serrated disc.

i'm in a college assembly programming class, and for a project i thought it'd be fun to do some dwarf fortress memory hacking. i figured, dfhack has been around for years, it's well-documented, surely it can't be too hard to go over their code and figure out enough to make something with basic functionality.

unfortunately, i've spent most of the weekend doing just that, and i'm starting to realize it might not be that easy. i don't really feel any closer to being able to do anything, and it doesn't help that most of dfhack is written in ruby and lua,, and the only language i really know is c++.

so, does anyone have any experience memory hacking without dfhack? or, do you know any good resources for it? i don't need to be able to do anything spectacular, just reading some basic map information from memory would probably be fine for now."

278,"i have a dumb idea for a fort: beefort  


the rules of beefort:

0. any item or dwarf that violates the rules of beefort is atom smashed

1. all dwarves must have a ""b"" in their name.
2. all items must have a ""b""  in their name \[bronze picks are ok, copper axes are not\], or be made from bee byproducts (royal jelly, honey, wax)
3. embarked biome must have a ""b"" in the name \[badlands, shrubland, etc\]
4. all kept animals must have a ""b"" in their name \[named pets are ok if they follow the rules\]
5. all above-ground construction must be made of wax
6. items starting with ""b"" are to be prioritized

&amp;#x200b;

i figure this provides some easy restrictions on food and metals to work around \[berries, beers, bronze, etc\], but clothing will be a challenge. 

&amp;#x200b;

any other suggestions?"

280,"hi y'all how is it going?

after playing on and off for a couple of years now i came to a point when i cannot bond anymore with my fortresses. 

what do i mean with that? 
every time i start a new fortress i can enjoy it until about the second migrant wave than after that my interest in the fortress falls inevitably and the gameplay becomes stale. i think this is due to a lack of interest from my part in the story of the world and because i feel that i can confidently manage to reach a healthy and secure 100+ fortress without too much trouble.

i'm looking for advice on how to gain interest again in the narrative of the world so i can feel like my fortresses really matter and are not just some random dwarven settlements.

i think that i should delve deeper into the new relations, raiding and economic-ties mechanics too have a better feel of being part of a larger world as well as using legends viewer to make a story for myself. 

i got myself thinking about how good it would be to be able to send out a caravan with goods to sell like the mountainhome does (future update maybe?). "

282,"the more i think about the way dwarf fortress is designed, the more i fear that the game will eventually reach a breaking point. with everything running on one thread, weird ui and just a sort of ambiguous nature to the way the game is coded, i fear that eventually it'll get to a point that maintaining and fixing all this legacy code will be nearly impossible, with eventually simple fixes taking forever, and the game not running well or at all due to poor optimization. this is just a thought i've been having though and i was wondering if anyone else has thought the same thing."

"
286,"so i made a post with my attempt of creating my df by drawing and it wasn't all that faithful to the original so i managed to find a better way to do it.

what you need: a dwarf fortress heightmap, /r/ck2generator and gimp(i don't really know photoshop but should be doable too);


1. if you already have a world open df, go to legends, press ""d"" to export detailed map and choose elevations including lake and ocean floors.

2. open the new generated map(should be in your df main folder) in gimp.

3. select the scale tool(shift + t) and in tool options change the interpolation to ""none"". here you should scale your image to the standard ck2 map sizes,  i recommend 2048x2048 px.

4. copy the layer with the new image and go to file&gt;create&gt;from clipboard, the map should be in the right size now. i recommend erasing small islands with black color.

5. now the complicated part, ck2 only sees land as grey rgb above 96/96/96 and df doesn't follow that. you have to go to colors&gt;curves, here you have a graph but it's quite simple really, 
click the graph and try to put the curve point in the northwestern part of the square in the 3rd row 3rd column.

6. check the rgb of a coastline with the color picker tool, if is still below 96 repeat step 5 increasing the curve. go to file&gt;export and save your map.

7. open ck2generator, set your game install folder, go to map generator then on heightmap tab click on load and choose your map, change the map size to small(2048) then click generate.

8. the program will look frozen but don't worry it takes a while to do it, once is finished you can generate the history with your map.


obs: if you generate the history there's a bug that you have to fix in order for it to work on ck2, go to your new mod folder and find the 00_religions file, change all ',' commands with '.' dots and for the color line replace "" with { and }.

wrong: 		color = ""0,2705882 0,1098039 0,9843137""

wright: 		color = { 0.2705882 0.1098039 0.9843137 }"

hello. i am playing on a world where i took over a dying civilization of dwarves. i managed already to build three fortresses, and this one is the third.  


i always fall at the same spot: the downward spiral. basically, it looks like the dwarves stop collecting bodies, and the fortress get overwhelmed with dead invaders, citizens, pets and miasma... it is an unsatisfying slow death...."
288,"greetings fellow urists, after a long time away from actually playing, i just redownloaded and started a new fort. 

my main goal was to see if i could turn an everburning coal bar in a steel bin into a weapon of painful death. 

made a hallway of ignited binned coal and forced some treelovers to walk through it. 

unfortunately nothing happened. 

then i remembered back in the day (way back in the day) steam could literally melt the fat off of a creature, i then proceeded to dump a lake on that burning coal bin to see what would happen. 

nothing. it just didn't do a thing. 

i had a sad. 

so, i'm wondering: can you mod syndromes onto steam?

i searched the raws and couldn't actually find a 'steam' object. 

does anyone here have experience with such things? i'd love some direction or advice. 

thanks in advance. "

291,"so i recently found out that df comes with a square tileset right out of the box, which is great! but (due to what i think is the small resolution) i find text hard to read. does anybody know any good ascii tilesets similar or the same as the one included with df that might make reading things a bit easier?"
292,"do you think we could get a nintendo switch version of dwarf fortress? 

i mean i've seen it running on some really low quality machines (pocket worlds with short histories mostly etc) so i don't think it would be a stretch for the hardware. and the sticks could easily navigate menus or even embed a software keyboard for naming.

i'm just thinking about this because i just took my nintendo switch with me on an 18 hour international flight and if i could have some dwarf fortress next time i do it i would be a very happy dworf.

granted i'd like to see toad focus on completing development of the game, but it'd be nice to have on my nintendo.

293,"roughly ~10 years into embark, nigh 200 dorfs, high wealth, recently incorporated into our civilization, a werecat wandered into the ageless temple of animals. my fortress has two clear and distinct ""eras"" so to speak: pre-cavern and post-cavern. pre-cavern, most of the fortress was four z-levels down, and while well defended by virtue of a reasonably sized barracks, the first bedrooms were only at -5. these took the form of blocks of ~12 bed rooms with a common area in the center and a dinning hall and temple at one end. i created five of these before i decided to settle and tame the cavern (quite successfully, i might add, and thanks to help from some of the other urists in this subreddit).

werecats attack, and at first there was one, who killed one dwarf and bit three before meeting his fate, but then those three dwarves infected another four, and monthly chaos ensued. this was a real headscratcher for me. a major source of infection was actually the hospital. dwarves who were bitten were often still bedridden until they turned, and were in prime position to infect the hapless altruists of the fort who retrieved them. 

luckily, my hospital was adapted from an old barracks, and when i realized most of the werecats were in there i was easily able to forbid passage to the hospital, and close my ears to the sounds of the cats tearing apart the few uninfected remaining inside. unfortunately i found that a few more had survived outside the hospital.

then i had a thought. ""hm,"" thought i, ""i have a bunch of food storage, beds, and just room in general accessible by a 3 tile hallway. what if i just make a burrow inside, restrict my civvies to the burrow, and then lock the door? i have 30 axe and hammer dwarves who can repopulate, and migrants will come eventually. and after awhile the werecat problem will just sort itself out!""

and so far, it has! i built a few mason's workshops and craftsdwarves' stations inside so that the dorf's could occupy themselves crafting increasingly high quality coffins and mugs before their deaths. i slightly underestimated how quickly they would die, however. at the start of this experiment, i had about 175-200 dwarves. now, their number has dwindled to about 65, discounting werecats, who are roughly a dozen in number. the optimist in me, however, forced me to build an ""airlock"", allowing me to, under strict supervision and vetting, release a slow trickle of dwarves, including a possessed jeweler. a couple hammerdwarves were locked in by mistake, but they help thin the population a little faster and a little ""cleaner"" (bashing someone's brains out with one hit rather than tearing their guts out with your bare hands as part of a mob is cleaner, right?).

dwarf science is being committed. many of the test subjects have been hurt in the making of this post, but also being forced to live in a small space has made many of them happier overall, as now they have the opportunity to enjoy the taverns and temples to their fullest now that they have all the time in the world before their death at the hands of their peers."
294,"so, an interesting component that could compose a dwarven culture could be sports, randomly generated, with aggressiveness or intelectuality proportional to the average dwarf in the fortress. it could range from board games to rugby with stones, it would be really exciting to imagine what kind of entertainment they could come up with.

i know, saying is easy... but one can dream."
295,"im looking for mods that add missing ""traditional"" fantasy races like orcs or halflings and also add creatures from dnd/pathfinder like oozes or elementals or fey creatures or saytrs or different types of demons and dragons and just generally adds more variety to the monsters in the game. as lame as it sounds, i primarily play the game for the legends mode, i just love reading the stories the game creates, so i don't care about mechanics or items as much. thanks!!"
296,"it would be interesting to have a game mode where you control a civ and you can do things like decide where to settle and attack cities. and maybe have something where you can control an invading army.

ps: still looking for saves of nice forts. (generated with meph tileset v4 or higher)"
299,"i thought this was an interesting bit of dwarven history. usually, fortresses are so easy to lose. treeroad, however, kept hanging on for dear life despite its inevitable demise with all it had.

it started in the year 125. for approximately the first year and a half, it had a smooth start. the main fortress was excavated from below the forested plain. the textile industry and the meal preparation industry for both domestic purposes and trading purposes to exchange for steel had a strong start.

the first nail in the coffin was hammered in on the 19th of hematite, 126. a human in the form of a werepanda decided to visit this fledgling trade center on the outskirts of the territory of their parent civilization. the squadron of five, with badger blood still on their hands from an earlier massacre, were dispatched to confront their twisted foe.

a trader was bitten far before any trained military dwarves had a shot. this victim was one one with little promise but was brave in the face of danger and could not see themself ever backing down from the fight for their life. after being expelled for the sake of the collective, they still refused to back down.

after a short time, the militia approached this existential threat along with many children that were playing in the sunshine. four more were bitten including two of the younglings. only one dwarf died: a swordsman that was recently added with the most recent migration wave.

the bitten dwarves were unwilling to be quarantined for the sake of the collective. by the time the sun set on the 17th of malachite, it was already too late. they laid siege to their own brethren. 

when they transformed back into their original states, naked and covered in blood, forty dwarves had died and the human caravan faced complete annihilation. some snapped under the pressure and killed without any rhyme or reason, freeing the weaker from a prolonged suffering. there were not enough caskets to contain the deceased and far too many infected to ever contain this new bio weapon.

the 15th of galena was no different. when autumn came, one hundred civilians and animals perished by the hands of this werepanda menace. the curse had carved its way into the history of treeroad with no hope of recovery. the stench of miasma swept through the temple and the communal dining room. most were showing symptoms of the stress placed upon them. some were without the ability to walk and died of dehydration where they laid as others were too stressed to focus on a task for long. the populace were unwilling to rise up against the werepanda dwarves, instead deciding to name them according to how many they killed. some had seven kills to their christened names; some thirteen.

as the dwarven caravan came in, expecting a profit from the promising upstarts, they were greeted by death. bodies laid all around the central pillar and some in the training grounds. the bodies of livestock were scattered across the land once called home. the survivors sold some of the meals they had left for a means of defense: a bronze sword, a steel buckler, and an iron mace. the diplomat waited desperately for the mayor's attention, but the incapacitated noble insisted that someone had already queued up a meeting for emotional counseling. they left depressed, ready to inform their homeland that treeroad was a failure.

migrants came for two more seasons. nothing changed. there were three werepandas left by the end of the year 126. one peasant held thirty one deaths: a new record among his infected kind. after a handful of full moons, the final werebeast lost his mental constitution and ran around the fortress, speaking incoherently. they had no clothes to cast aside. the werebeast menace was gone, but there were only ten dwarves left: six of them children; all of them on the brink of meeting the same fate as their final physical threat. the ghosts of those slain began to raise up, all of them held murderous intent with one exception who simply remained near their body.

all of the remaining adults were drafted into the military in some hope that if another accursed creature came, they would be able to meet that threat. food and alcohol stocks were enough to last them until their untimely deaths, whether by madness brought on by their conditions as of late or by defending their territory. they labored day and night in preparation, only stopping to sleep and eat. 

a hivemind mentality began to form: no new caravans. there was no time for diplomacy. there was no more wiggle room for another threat seeping into their lands. when spring came and the elves visited again seeking their attention, they were met with the call for their eradication. two horses and two elves were murdered, their spoils laid where they dropped for the keas to take away as they saw fit. 

two of the remaining adults withdrew from their duties: one decided to abandon their ties and attempted to murder their former companions; they were met with swift retribution. the other sat down and never moved again, staring off into the distance. the youths played in an attempt to ward off the trauma all while being accosted by the five vindictive spirits who served as reminders of the tragedy the adults brought upon them.

two grown dwarves remained: one was the captain of the guard and the other was the captain of the guard. they were arbitrary titles by this point, but who was there to stop them? they opened up their dining halls once bustling with their countrymen as a place for visitors in the galena of 127. little did these tourists know that the granite floors were to soon be running with their blood. the last remaining wanted to die and saw trained adventurers as the only thing that could stop them. three dwarven progeny remained. sixteen ghosts now haunted their prison. one of them howled continuously, dashing any hope of getting a proper sleep.

poets and bards dropped by to practice their craft, but never were able to finish a single performance. most did not have the luxury to catch a glimpse of the stairs to their promised venue. hammerdwarves, marksdwarves, macedwarves, and the like received the same treatment. the captain and the mayor came to a frightening realization after their eighteenth kill: they went without a single scratch throughout their entire campaign. their plan had backfired; they became too strong to be killed by any sightseer and the looming threats thought their land too insignificant to pay any mind to.

they had one last plan. one remaing method to plot their own destruction. they exterminated the performance-seekers: these were of no threat. the rest of these partiers were left until a large group of adventurers caught sight of their rest stop. the spirits of the slain were attacking the offspring, their numbers cut down to one. even the last remaining child had their left leg taken away at the knee.

at last, a group of seven appeared searching for food, alcohol, and a place to rest before leaving for other foreign lands. this was the duo's chance. they waited until all of the outsiders grouped up to socialize in the miasma-filled blood-splattered cavern. once the swordsdwarf joined up with his group, the nobles found their time to strike. amongst the chaos, the captain was struck down. the mayor lost his ability to walk, his feet were tattered and smashed open. no medics were around to take him to the makeshift hospital; no alcohol was around to sustain him until starvation set in. he would meet his long-awaited demise, but in the slowest and most painful way possible.

two months passed. the mayor finally died with a crooked smile on his face. the child was the last remaining dwarf. all the halls were devoid of life. the innocent were gone. these stubborn, bearded degenerates who saw fleeing as a coward's game left their own seed abandoned, starved, dehydrated, and with no expectation to ever survive. she waited for death to come for them with seventeen ghosts surrounding her. they taunted her, not allowing her to escape her past or even allow her to sleep. her passing was the last act in the chronicle of treeroad."

302,"i've taken on a bit of a challenge, starting up a fort in the front lawn of a dark goblin fortress. four years in, my first tantrumer got voluntold to go kick their (beak) dog. cue a siege of about 280 three months later.

so i'm hiding behind my bridge of cowardice, watching the invaders work their way through my meat grinder of a trapline, when a visiting scholar flips their biscuit and *tears up five of my traps while tantruming,* then heads back into my fort. they penetrate my entire trapline, and it's only due to the brave actions of two waves of military (including trainees) that the invaders did not successfully penetrate my fort's defenses.

apparently he continued tantruming and punched another scholar, while the goblins laughed. i may give this butthead residence just so i can give him a properly !!warm!! welcome. i also may just give this whole area a season to rot away before reclaiming it.

this game, seriously."
303,"the dorf fort of hallcats is a forest outpost at the top of a waterfall. they've got a frontier style wooden palisade around some alpaca pastures. the only way in and out is the caravan road, which crosses the river right above the falls.  

hallcats is a young fort with only 20 dorfs. when you don't have a military, the next best thing is a tavern full of mercenaries... so that's what they have going on for defense right now.  

i accidentally left a hatch cover leading to the caverns unlocked and a ranger decided to go exploring down there. moments later the ranger came back to get a drink, towing a troll behind him. the troll headed straight for the tavern, naturally.  

that's where one very drunk human hammerman beat the shit out of the troll without taking any damage. then, our guest the hammerman became nauseous from exertion and drunkenness, and started to puke everywhere. he stumbled upstairs to get fresh air, and a lone dog sacrificed her own life finishing off the troll. all the urists cold bounced to the safety of their bugout burrow, so thank goodness for that valiant doggo.  

anyhow, the almost-savior of hallcats (the human hammerman) staggered to the surface, vomited one last time, fell into the river and went over the falls. wearing full bronze armor.

304,"hello, reddit! i'm working with a lot of inspiration thanks to your support. today i'm going to finish my work regarding df-gurps attributes convertion, dealing with soul attributes.

most of those attributes either are included in iq (intelligence) description of gurps or represented by corresponding advantages and disadvantages.

#soul attributes

1. analytical ability.

there is no description of this attribute on df wiki, but the value-description chart often refers to it as ""intelligence"". i also think that analytical ability is an important part of intelligence, so this attribute falls into iq description.

2. focus.

there is no measure of focus as a stat in gurps - if it is higher or lower than average, it is represented by corresponding advantage or disadvantage, such as short attention span. the skills that are based on focus in df depend from iq in gurps.
despite that these attributes work differently in terms of mechanics, i can't see a solid reason to change it, but it's not my final word. i just feel that in roleplaying game it works fine with advantages/disadvantages (e.g. absent-mindness).

3. willpower.

""willpower directly reduces exertion and pain effects. also prevents creatures from fleeing in battle"". gurps also has willpower as a secondary attribute that depends from iq, with almost the same description. these stats match perfectly and don't requre any changes.

4. creativity.

the situation with creativity is the same as with focus - higher or lower creativity is represented by advantages/disadvantages (such as versatile and hidebound). skills that depend on creativity are based on iq. since creativity is a rare thing to put to use in a roleplaying game (it usually depends on the player), i think that it's fine to let it be unchanged.

5. intuition.

it's a great mystery for me how intuition could be measured as an attribute. nevertheless, in a roleplaying game the intuition of the player, not the character, is in charge. for the terms of simplicity intuition will be tied to intelligence too; high stat could be represented with intuition advantage.

6. patience, memory.

now i think it would be better to group attributes with the same commentary: skills tied to iq, shown by advantages and disadvantages. the level of patience in a roleplaying game depends on the player, but some disadvantages (e.g. impulsiveness) will restrict them; eidetic memory will help the player to remember the name of important npc or some other details, representing high memory stat in df.

7. linguistic ability.

language problem is quite interesting: it seems like every member of a sapient race in df knows all languages. gurps has their own language system, where you need to buy language knowledge much like ordinary advantage. poor linguistic ability could be represented by lower levels of known languages (for example, you can write poorly), a good linguistic ability in general - by language talent advantage.

8. spatial sense.

despite that this is soul attributes, i would refer this characteristic to dexterity. dexterity in gurps is not only a measure of general quickness - it's also responsible for reflexes and coordination. concidering the fact that corresponding skills in gurps are based on dx, spatial sense is most close to dexterity. some advantages like absolute direction could represent a character that has a good coordination in general.

9. musicality.

as almost any skill that doesn't involve physical labour, any skill related to music is based on iq. to represent a gift of musicality, gurps uses the talent (musical ability), which provides bonuses to any skills related to music.
poor musicality is harder to represent; gurps has a different core principle: character either has a skill or doesn't. *technically* every dwarf in df has some skills in music, so the level of difference is quite big. i don't think musicality is so crucial to significantly change gurps though, so i will left it as it is.

10. kinestetic sense.

anything related to movement has nothing to do with iq; while this attribute affects almost all physical skills, much like dx in gurps does, this is almost exact variation of dexterity.

11. empathy and social awareness.

these attributes are represented by corresponding advantages/disadvantages
(i'm too tired to write the same thing for so many times :p), like empathy, charisma, smooth operator etc. nothing of basic attributes refer to social interaction, so it cannot be strictly measured.

phew, this is finally over. next stop of the development train is further character creation, mostly preferences. i'll try to provide some sort of generator chart to simulate df random preference creation.

*sorry for the delay, got busy with my uni homework and an interesting volcano fortress :p*

*advantages and disadvantages are character's features, which cost points (disadvantages have negative cost, thus providing more points for you to use).*"
305,"hey, i just released a few updates for my mods if you guys are interested - the mods i maintain are my [main pack with stuff from warcraft, dragon's dogma and more](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=158898.msg7057914#msg7057914), the [lands of duality good/evil biome revamp](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=170730.0), the [what lurks below cavern revamp](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=167606.msg7575487), the [zombies ate my dwarves horror pack](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=168066.0) and the [dwarfest dungeon pack](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=168740.0).


the updates are fairly minor flavor changes, mostly altered identity names (so i.e instead of ""cannibal criminals"" you'll have ""cannibal vegetarians"" potentially visiting your fort), a few changed profession names (so races where having ""peasants"" wouldn't be fitting have different names for them as an equivalent, i.e ""tribesmen"", ""laborers"" or ""drudges"") and a few bugfixes. lands of duality and my main pack have a few more specific changes (some minor creature alterations mostly). my main pack, the dwarfest dungeon one and the zombies ate my dwarves one should have some different in-game music now as well (only with the full packs, though, not included in the raws-only downloads)


i've also uploaded [most of my personal mod folders up on mega](https://mega.nz/#!dc1xhtir!hxhj-72waeywtppplh1tbjthgbniewhzm8gqauvjv4y), barring most vanilla files (except ones that have changes for compatibility purposes), incase you want to have an easy download for a compiled version of all of the above. i should warn its definitely not going to be thematically coherent, if you care for that - for example chainsaw-wielding cannibalistic hillbillies fighting alongside the ogres from warcraft against the forces of the swinefolk from darkest dungeon, who have allied themselves with mutated circus-themed eldritch freaks and skull-faced aliens who wield futuristic technology, would definitely be a possible worldgen scenario.


that should be it - i'd appreciate any feedback or personal stories if you use my mods, it really helps!"
306,"  

it’s a bit later than i’d hoped, as i've been struggling a bit with things – but it’s finally here! the culmination of the last two months. so sit back, relax, and read on to find out the results of the grand finale!

&amp;#x200b;

it’s been a long and gruelling summer in the arena. two months ago, 64 bright eyed and bushy tailed gladiators signed themselves up, putting their very lives on the line to earn them and their managers a place in history. they came from all corners of the world – kobolds and trolls, animal-men and men-men, all looking for a chance at glory. as the weeks passed they fought, they tried, and many, many died. the pool of fighters diminished, but those remaining learned. they fought harder, smarter, and with better gear too. but you know how it is – there can only be one. and so now, after weeks of fighting, just two remain. without further delay, let’s get right into the grand finale… 

# matchup 6a – the grand finale

notorious breakfast (managed by /u/crayolaclock) vs sliver (managed by /u/average_toast)

**through the top gate** enters our first finalist of this year – notorious breakfast! about twice the size of a human, this tapir man and former mercenary has shown time and again that he’s one mean killing machine. easily defeating mrs snips in round 1, breakfast went on to claim victory against fan favourite toady one in round 2. his rampage against much loved fighters had only just begun, as he then fought and killed the silent but deadly great hollow hakan in round 3. many thought breakfast would fall in round 4 – after all, who could best the mighty korg grimhoof? 

well, it turns out notorious breakfast could, and he did, making it into the semi-finals where he put an end to the valiant ser floof. now he stands in the arena for one last time, to finish what he started all those weeks ago. 

clad in brightly painted adamantine armour and wielding his infamous steel morningstar he stands confidently, almost at ease. but his eyes tell a different story. they gaze out with a hard edge, deep and thoughtful. 

**from the bottom gate** enters our second finalist of the year – sliver. although less than a third the size of his opponent, nobody who has seen the rodent man fight can question his ability to kill. nobody expected much from the rat man at the start of this tournament, even sliver himself seemed reluctant to fight. but fight he did, slaying cave johnson in round 1 and then the self-proclaimed ‘god’ dagoth ur in round 2. but it seemed as if his luck would run out in round 3 – how could an unarmoured rodent man beat a fully armoured lion man? 

but beat him he did, although sliver came a hairs breadth from dying himself in the process. the rat man started to gain quite the following, and it only grew as he killed the commie revolutionary che gorilla in the quarter-finals, and then fellow underdog griv cromblo in the semis. now sliver stands here once more, and for the last time. 

rumours say that he’s fighting to support his family, to support an orphanage that has already lost too much. a worthy cause, and one with a worthy fighter. he wields his adamantine longsword with some tension, his grip tight. for the first time this tournament sliver has opted to more armour than a linen loincloth, wearing a mix of adamantine and leather. as always, he looks somewhat remorseful. but behind that reluctance to kill is an even bigger willingness to do what is needed for his children. he arrived here weeks ago for a reason, and he’s going to finish it here and now or very well die trying. 

**the atmosphere** **is tense**, the stands are packed, and even the grounds surrounding the arena are filled with those who couldn’t make it in but want to at least hear the action. fans of both gladiators cheer and sing and chant, huge banners and flags creating a patchwork of colour. among the crowd can be seen mercenaries who’ve worked with breakfast, their colourful armour distinctive. also present is a large contingent of rodent men, as sliver has become something of a mascot for the often-downtrodden race. a lot is riding on these two gladiators – hopes, dreams, and a good deal of bet money. who will win and claim championship this year, and who will fall having come so far?

[combat log](https://pastebin.com/xee7b6sl)

**the horn is blown, and the gladiators are at each other!** sliver opens the fighting with a skilful strike that is only just parried by his opponent – notorious’ reply is easily dodged in return. the first few blows go the same way, each unable to break the defence of the other. then suddenly sliver manages to get through his foe’s defence, landing a slash that skids off breakfast’s armour but clearly leaves him somewhat unnerved. seconds later and again sliver gets through, but once again adamantine armour deflects his blow. 

the two continue their back and forth, and it soon becomes clear that the smaller, lighter and perhaps more skilled sliver has the advantage, his attacks consistently manging to land on his opponent. but each and every time breakfast is saved by his armour, and soon he seems to acquire a confidence of sorts that he cannot be hurt by the small rodent man. his eyes flash with bravado and he pushes the attack on the enemy, his morningstar whirling with greater speed.

but his ego comes too soon. he overextends his reach and before he can rebalance himself sliver’s sword comes hurtling for his head. breakfast can only just dodge, but the blade still strikes him just, cleaving off an ear clean from the head. blood spatters the two fighters, and fans from both sides of the crowd go wild as first blood is drawn. it’s not a mortal wound by any means, but the pain clearly angers notorious, and he throws himself at his enemy with a renewed vigour. 

sliver in return also ramps up his attack, and soon the two fighters are really going at one another. weeks of killing and learning have come down to this, and they both display masterful skill with their weapons and dodges alike. their deadly dance is captivating, steel and flesh moving as if one, weapons acting like natural extensions of the hand. 

again and again sliver lands blows on his opponent whilst sustaining none himself, but each and every time he is unable to penetrate the larger fighter’s armour. at one point a elegant twirl of his sword catches the silken cape that breakfast so proudly wears and tears it at once to shreds. this really seems to set something off in the tapir man. he snarls and throws himself at sliver, sending the two fighters crashing to the arena floor. sliver, somewhat surprised by the ferocity of the charge, scrambles to get out from under his larger opponent. but as he does so notorious is already bringing his weapon to bear. the steel morningstar ploughs its course and strikes sliver in the lower leg, twisting it with such force that the leg twists, buckles and then totally splits at the knee. the crowd can only gasp, whilst sliver lets out a noiseless scream. he stumbles, teeters, and then collapses, his ruined leg unable to take his weight.

those who have seen previous fights in this arena know full well the danger of being immobilized like this. sliver himself is certainly aware, and a look of pure fear flashes across his face as he realises his new situation. breakfast, on the other hand, reclaims some of his trademark confidence, pushing his newfound advantage without hesitation. he pummels the rodent man who, still in shock from his wound, seems unable to mount a proper defence. it isn’t until he’s taken a couple of vicious blows that sliver is able to shake himself out of his stun and fight back.

from his prone position on the ground, sliver is unable to do any real fighting but he astounds many with his desperate defence. he rolls and scrambles away from his enemy’s attacks, even managing to block and parry some of them. but the pain of his wounds and the difference in size and position are really starting to take their toll as the tables turn more and more against him. a growing look of fear clouds his eyes and face, fear for himself, or perhaps fear for the lives of those he is fighting to protect? 

even with the odds now so stacked against him sliver manages to lands hits on his foe, displaying a fighting spirit and skill that fans from both sides find almost unbelievable. but he’s also accumulating wounds at a dangerous rate, his arms, legs and gut soon torn and bleeding. still he fights on, still he defends himself. some more blows land and his armour is all but broken, sliver himself is vomiting from pain and shock and covering his already bloody body in bile and sick and *still* he fights on. a nasty strike to the arm renders sliver without the use of his weapon, and even as his sword clatters to the floor the rodent man fights on, clawing and snapping at his opponent. 

the crowd are transfixed by the sheer tenacity on display here. even breakfast seems shaken, his attacks raining down on the bloody and battered rodent man but failing to put him down for good. notorious swings his weapon and brings it down what seems like one final time – the blow smashes across sliver’s face, sending teeth across the arena floor and leaving his nose hanging by a tendon. his face devastated, his limbs mangled and his body shattered, sliver still yet breathes. all eyes are on the rodent man but his eyes are far away, glazed over as if he is seeing something that nobody else is privy to. he moves his bloody lips weakly as if to say something, some final words to his foe before it’s all over. 

notorious leans in to listen, but as he does so he notices the rodent man’s hand moving. perhaps he meant to merely beckon him closer, perhaps he meant to attack. whatever the case, what message (if any) he had to pass on is lost as notorious breakfast reflexively brings his morningstar down with all the weight he can muster. the strike lands heavily right in the centre of the rodent man’s face, caving it in and leaving a gory crater in its place. blood and brains spatter notorious as he pauses, leaning on his weapon and panting with exertion. 

the crowd erupts with energy, equal measures joy and sorrow. notorious himself merely seems tired, though he has claimed victory with only an ear lost. which puts him in a much better state than his opponent. 

&amp;#x200b;

congratulations /u/crayolaclock! through masterful management your gladiator has achieved victory and earned the title **champion of the arena 2018!** 

&amp;#x200b;

\---

&amp;#x200b;

security work hard to stop the crowd from piling into the arena. the arena gnomes quickly descend onto the floor, cleaning the blood and hauling off sliver’s body to the morgue. notorious, his energy now returning to him, does a little celebratory lap of the arena, his smile growing as he realised it’s all over. he’s finally won. all these weeks of fighting, and it’s finally done. 

or is it?

the crowd suddenly go silent, their cheers turning to hushed whispers of mystery and excitement. notorious breakfast, who was about to leave the arena, turns to see a small robed figure enter the arena from the gate opposite him. the look on his face turns in an instant from one of celebration to one of consternation. he grips his morningstar tightly, waiting for security to deal with the unknown. but security don’t deal with them – instead they actually close the gates at either end, locking breakfast in with the mysterious figure. notorious frowns. who is this, and what are they doing here? is this a joke?

as if in response to his thoughts, the figure shrugs off his black robes. the audience suddenly explode with cheers and exclamations of surprise. for standing there is none other than the world’s most infamous lying, lacerating and darn lucky lizard man – beorge gush. after winning the first tournament two years ago, the little fighter disappeared and almost faded out of memory. that is until last year, when he famously returned to defend his title, killing finalist jabber to defend his claim before once more disappearing from the world. now, seemingly out of nowhere, beorge is back to defend his hard-won title, and if he wants to win it all notorious will have to take it from him. 

the crowd settle and resume their seats with bated breath. the arena gnomes get on the drums, and the horn blower steps into position. it’s time for one last fight.

# matchup 6b – the contest match

notorious breakfast (managed by /u/crayolaclock) vs beorge gush (managed by /u/mistermartijn)

**notorious of course needs no introduction.** buoyed up from his victory over sliver, and standing over three times the size of beorge, surely this fight will be even easier than the last? 

**beorge himself should need no introduction either, but here is one anyway.** many will remember this plucky little fighter, who made a name for himself  two years ago in the first ever tournament held in this arena. send to fight as a punishment for instigating a coup in a dwarven fortress, the little lizard man rapidly gained a fan following for his skills with a dagger. finally killing the seemingly undefeatable jonsssssnoe liveth in round 4, he went on to claim victory against gary the troll in an extremely tense grand finale, overcoming terrible wound to win the day. 

beorge went missing after that fight, only to reappear one year later. this time he returned to fight jabber, the hulking giant tortoise man who had just claimed victory in the grand finale of tourney 2. it was a bloody fight, and a bloody close one at that, but beorge successfully defeated jabber to rightfully retain hold of his title as grand champion of the arena. now he’s back to attempt the same again, equipped just as he was when he first won all those years ago. his iron armour looks a little more dented and rusted, his adamantine dagger a bit more chipped. but his eyes flash with that same dangerous cunning that earned him his title in the first place. he’s clearly not giving it up without a fight. 

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78os57vincc)

[combat log](https://pastebin.com/a4cl2dne)

**the horn is blown for the final time, and the two fighters are at each other!** beorge opens with a snappy stab of his dagger that lands true on his opponent, only to be easily defeated by their armour. what follows is a eerily similar fight to the one the audience just witnessed, with beorge able to land strikes but the adamantine in his way proving unyielding to them. the two fighters continue their deadly dance, notorious at first cautious but then growing in confidence as he realises that he has the defensive advantage in this fight, even if not the better skill. 

back and forth they attempt to wound the other, until finally one of them succeeds. notorious lands a glancing blow on his opponent’s foot, but beorge is only equipped with his old iron armour. whether out of stubbornness or short-sightedness this isn’t clear, but either way he pays the price. breakfast’s steel morningstar easily crushes the iron boot, tearing open the foot and sending the lizard man careening to the arena floor in a spurt of blood and a yelp of pain. 

beorge continues to fight from his prone position, seemingly unphased by his wound. but his situation only worsens, and notorious lands blow after blow on the little fighter. much like a nut in a cracker, beorge’s bones and body are broken and shattered and pummelled with unforgiving force from notorious. the lizard man’s attempt to defend himself grow weaker until, with a small smile and a strangely peaceful look in his beady eyes, he falls unconscious. notorious pauses, but only briefly. then he brings his weapon to bear one last time – lodging it deep within the recesses of beorge’s skull to finally put the famous fighter to sleep.

if it’s even possible, the crowd erupt with a noise even louder than before. this time security can do nothing to stop them swarming into the arena and hoisting notorious breakfast onto their shoulders whilst they chant his name. the tapir man looks absolutely exhausted, but for the first time he also looks truly at ease. not the fake arrogant kind of ease he normally puts out, but a real deep contentment. he’s done it. this time, he’s really actually gone and done it.  yes, one day he may have to return to defend his title. 

but for now, at least for today, he can relax.

308,"i hope a mod request is appropriate here. i'm under no delusions that this means i snap and it comes into being, of course, just wishing. also i'd like to know if the access available to modders would even allow such a thing.

simply, left and right margins on, specifically the thoughts page, but anywhere the text goes across the full length of the screen. centered with a thick margin on either side would be infinitely more readable, even a 2-column set up would be an improvement. 

after so many years of playing this game, i have to admit i get serious fatigue from reading it, and i love reading and games with reading. but i end up not even checking out people past my initial dwarves because it's just unpleasant when it doesn't need to be, and something like a simple margin is still resilient against future updates (as in, i love that ui is pushed down so far in favor of deep mechanics, but this is an easy fix)"

314,"hello again, reddit! today i wanna share the fruits of my labour with you. as i promised, i began working on the df roleplaying game, and my first report is about the basics of character creation.

the first thing that all players encounter while creating a character is attributes. attributes define hero's natural characteristics and affect future generation, such as skill value, damage, speed, etc. the main part of this ""development diary"" is to make some correlations between gurps and df.

gurps has much less attributes than df (4 against 19). there are two reasons for it:

1. main attributes in gurps (such as intelligence) is a combination of many attributes that are split into different characteristics in df.

2. there are also some secondary attributes in gurps, some of which are pretty close to df attributes.

to make a proper df expancion for gurps, some correlations between attributes in different systems must be made. today's theme is body attributes (soul attributes will be finished in a couple of days).

it's pretty convenient that the average stats for df is 1000 (basic human level) and the same is for gurps, where the average level of an attribute is 10. the power level of attributes if keeping 1:100 system of gurps-df relevance is also reasonably accurate - keeping in mind that df by nature is not so realistic as gurps.


#body attributes



1. strength.

dwarf fortress wiki and gurps basic set define strength mostly identical. it affects damage and how much a creature can carry. in gurps strength affects hp directly (base hp are equal to character's strength), in df it increases muscular mass that helps resisting damage. that means that no changes in gurps are required.

2. agility.

agility in df seems to affect speed only. dexterity in gurps is more complex, *directly* affecting dodge and basic speed (which is a measure of coordination and quickness). basic speed, a secondary attribute, seems to be closer to df definition than dexterity, so the most basic way to interpret df agility in gurps is to use basic speed. it's average value, however, is 5.00 (with a step of 0.25, because the calculation formula for it is (dx + ht)/4), which creates additional problems when trying to convert agility into basic speed. i'll make a proper system for it later, it'll most likely be some sort of correlation chart e.g. *basic speed 8.5 -&gt; extremely agile*.

3. toughness.

df wiki: ""(toughness) reduces physical damage of all kinds, including bleeding and suffocation"". the system for damage resistance in gurps is more complex, but the health attribute affects all rolls made to resist poison, to stop bleeding, to resist suffocation or mostly any effect that causes hp loss (not a blunt, piercing or slashing damage, but some other effects), *technically* reducing damage. the only thing that can reduce incoming damage is dr (damage resistance), but it mostly relates to armor. keeping in mind that dwarves have an average 1250 in toughness which means they are more *thiccc* than humans, they can possibly have a base dr 1 just from their skin. i'm not entirely sure yet. so toughness is close to health, despite that it doesn't affect every mind of damage.

4. endurance

endurance is the rate at which dwarves become exausted. gurps has a fp (fatigue points) value which represents the amount of energy that a creature has. fp value can change over time (like hp), lowering from work, weather conditions, hunger/thirst or lack of sleep and restores with rest and/or good meal. the more fp character has, the more work they can do before exaustion. so i think that fp is a proper attribute for this cause.

5. recuperation and disease resistance.

recuperation affects the rate of wound healing, while disease resistance speaks for itself. both of those attributes fall into the description of health attribute in gurps. i guess such a wide description of health was given to reduce the complexity of gurps (which is still quite hard as some people think). the most logical way here is to tie up both recuperation and disease resistance to health, but it could create some balance problems (raising or lowering hp will affect a total of three df attributes). perhaps i will create some way to split ht (health) into different characteristics corresponding to df-based ones, but i'm not sure yet. this is the biggest problem with body attributes and i would like to hear some ideas from you regarding the means to deal with it.

that's all for today! thank you for reading this, i hope that my monologue about mechanics and stuff wasn't too boring for you. i wait for your opinion and your thoughts about the work. see you in a couple of days!

319,"hi reddit! i just thought about creating a dwarf fortress tabletop roleplaying game, using various information and mechanics from the game. perhaps i will create a df-based gurps add-on book, because i have used it for about 5 years of playing as a gm.

right now i only have some thoughts and ideas, but if you feel like it could be a fun game for you, i'll start creating basic mechanics and collecting lore to make a raw version. i plan that this game will most likely be more close to adventure mode than to actual dwarf fortress, because of the nature of the roleplaying games itself. combat mechanics will be less debilitating for players, but otherwise brutal and detailed. i also want to provide a lot of different generators for the gm to help to create game world, monsters, history and much more.

i want to hear some sort of feedback from you - your thoughts about this project, advices, questions, just anything. it is really important for me to hear from you.

thank you for your attention!

321,"hello! first time poster here.

i'm interested in (not only playing some df) but also using it for world gen for dnd games (preferably 5e).

i'm just starting to learn about the ability to mod most things in df by adding/editing raw text files, which makes me wonder if it's possible, or ideally if it's already been done, to add in all the creatures from the monster manual, all the races/species etc into df so that world gen, history gen etc etc will fit in with a dnd campaign fully.

cheers!"
322,"so i don’t play dwarf fortress very often, but i when i started playing again after a long break, i eventually had all of my inhabitants infected and become weregeckos. something about the concept of a weregecko is simply incredible. i play dnd sometimes with my friends and they hate when i’m the dm because the twist ending is always that the bad guy was a gecko all along. i love weregeckos. they are the best part of dwarf fortress."

324,"i am a fairly new player and am still trying to wrap my head around dwarven physics. in my current fortress, i have dug a 25-z-level deep pit with a floor made of lead blocks for the purpose of prisoner execution. three trial runs with goblins have failed spectacularly, with all impact damage being “deflected by his &lt;&lt;yak wool glove&gt;&gt;” or other such nonsense. in fact, i’ve yet to cause so much as a sprained ankle with what should be, in my mind, a surefire death drop.

&amp;nbsp;

what am i missing? any help is appreciated.
"
325,"anytime i try to gen a world now, it rejects the world right after it places all the civs. no matter what i do, i never can get a world finalized. any help?"
326,"wait i think i have it. a safe material drop chute, for any distance, or object.

arrange a qsp on the upper dumping floor, or floors, dumping down the chute. at the bottom of the chute, instead of the qsp stockpile, have another minecart sitting on a stop, and dumping into a qsp stockpile. the cart on the floor below is set to dump when anything is placed into it. all of the deadly falling objects will now safely land in the minecart, and then be quietly upended into the stockpile falling 0 z levels and dealing no damage.

&amp;#x200b;

crafters and haulers will take from the lower floor qsp, and will have no reason to stand where the materials are dropped, unless they try to take materials from the minecart in the ticks before it dumps into the qsp.

&amp;#x200b;

i do wonder if crafters will try to take materials from the lower floor cart before it dumps, but set restricted traffic to the cart and the areas around it, and unrestricted traffic on a short hallway that allows dwarves to reach the cart from the side or rear. by the time any dwarf travels that hallway, whatever they wanted will have been dumped.

yes?"
327,"how do you organize pasturing space in your fort?

i recently came up with an idea i found kind of neat - at least, there have been zero incidents with it so far. the idea is as follows: you find a large grassland area somewhere above, channel 4-5 tiles around it for 2-3 tiles deep, build a wall up there for good measure and dig a stairway up to this artificial plateau from inside your fort. this way, you have a large, grassy, sunlit area you can use for all sorts of pasturing and outdoor farming and it's safe from outside hazards.

or is it? i heard some enemies can climb. am i in danger?"
328,"i've been really getting into adventure mode lately and have been trying out a lot of stupid stuff just to see what works. i just loving seeing how the different mechanics interact with each other. what are are your guy's favorite kinds of builds to play or just generally fun play styles?

i'll start off. i call this one ""the homing missile""

step 1: become a necromancer

step 2: start collecting limbs of sapient creatures (they don't have to be sapient but they do have to be able to grasp)

step 3: throw said limbs at some annoyingly fast prey

step 4: resurrect the limbs and watch as they beat your target into submission (bonus points if you use their own limbs)

step 5(optional): give a quick pommel strike and recollect for future use

this one can be pretty useful for any necromancer build as you don't really need any levels in throwing as it's the resurrected limb that does most of the work. alternatively you could just go around carrying entire corpses with you, but somehow that just seems like cheating. "
329,"recently played elephant man for the first time and was amazed to see a horses limb tear off and go flying when i kicked it out of boredom (i'm new to this game). throwing or kicking people to watch them fly 10 meters is fun as well.

do any of you know of any particularly fun things to play as in adventure mode? i know elephant seals and rhino people are close to the stregnth of elephants, and bugs can often be interesting due to the number of limbs you have avaliable."
330,i modded troglodytes to become trainable and domestic pets. something happened and now pretty much a caveman is in charge of my fortress. fun!!
331,"   so i'm not sure what happened, someone elses guess of what happened is the whole world collapsed one level which you will see in the video. i try to show that im not mining adamtine and such. 

   im curious what the possible causes are and if theres any way for me to continue playing this embark. i do play a little hacky, besides the normal shit i do (autodump stone), i accidentially pierced an aquifer in this embark, and tiletyped in a wall. the wall has been there for months or even a year game time so i can't image its that. the only thing that makes sense time wise is legends viewer, and i have no idea how that can cause this, but the night before i was poking around in it. and the next day this happened pretty soon after in terms of game time.

334,"specifically to u/iokwe_aolep for putting out a call for df streamers, and to the community as a whole for being awesome!

i said the other day that i've been considering streaming df for a while, but i'm *hella* rusty and haven't been sure how well it'd go down. seeing interest in it pushed me to stream it today, and i had a fantastic time! i... was not great, but i had a really fun stream, and some really helpful people in chat. definitely something i'll be doing again!

i really didn't just make this post just to shill my channel, but on the off-chance it's something people are interested in, [check me out here](http://twitch.tv/aifendragon). i'll be playing crusader kings ii from about 8am gmt tomorrow (wearing chainmail, because gimmicks) but plan to stream some more dwarf fortress in the afternoon!

mostly, just thanks again for being awesome, and keep being excellent to each other!
"
335,"so, after watching entire steelclutches series by kruggsmash, i recalled this story i read back in 2013 about a group of dwarves who embarked in an area surrounded by 14 necromancer towers. it is my favorite written dwarf fortress story (out of 7 or so i've read in all my years playing df), and so i decided to translate the first chapter of it into english - to create something for dwarf fortress community, to test my skill ~~and to farm some karma~~. and, well, here it is: [\[pdf\]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eytbzzvntb6ktq42e_j3tvrqrzfqmxtl).

so. what do you guys think? do you like it? should i continue? is it even a proper subreddit / website for this kind of content?

edit: link to original story in russian: [\[dfst.ru\]](http://dfst.ru/ru/stories/tag/messianic%20fortification)"
336,"i am once again trying to have fun. my dwarfs are afflicted by a vampire. my attempts to identify the vampire killed the first mayor and nearly killed the best metalsmith. the most recent vampire victim was found drained of blood, and i have one dwarf who was disgusted about watching that dwarf die. i think this means i’ve found the vampire. do vampires get disgusted by killing their victims?"
337,"this is the unwanted and horrible sequel to my facetious post about the dwarves being communist. are the dwarves really subscribed to contemporary ideology? no, it depends on the size of the fort and your playstyle, but it's a fun thought experiment. mayors are usually tame compared to the nobility, none of that hammerer beating the blacksmith crap; there tends to be a very short (sometimes extremely authoritarian) hierarchy. basic goods and services are freely distributed on the basis of need, there is no notion of currency inside fortress, with the obvious exception of caravans."
338,"alright urists, this is just too good not to make into a new thread. so i am playing meph's tileset launcher pack (sort of like masterwork lite) and it's got a few modded materials and decorations...  

my mayor had a mood and made,  
**gethustfikod, harshnessglazed, a large campfire coffer** (26400 dorfbux)  
this is a large campfire coffer. all craftdwarfship is of the highest quality. this object menaces with spikes of purple spinel. on the item is an image of three square cut gems in rhyolite.  

she built gethustfikod *with a clothier's shop*, using rhyolite, purple spinel... and *cave spider silk*.  

yup. moody dorfs can build artifact containers out of **large campfires** by starting with nothing more than spider silk. they must use a lot of silk, too, cause the thing weighs 200г.  

**update omg i just unpaused** the !!large campfire coffer!! is currently burning the loom. oh wow. oh wow. oh great dothrem the louse of spikes, hear my prayer and please let the !!fun!! be survivable. fuck. and we had just captured a live hydra for animal training, too. the whole workshop level is filling with smoke.  

**update #2, several ticks later** the loom and adjacent clothier's shop are fully engulfed. (t)aking a look at the workshop shows that gethustfikod is inside it. it cannot be dumped. i went to an empty pedestal and tried to place the gethustfikod, but it's not showing up in the list of artifacts. i'm going go try removing the workshop. oh fuck oh wow.   

the mayor is annoyed after choking on smoke underground. she feels satisfied after creating an artifact.   

**update #3** the mayor had too much !!fun!! all my leather, cloth, yarn, etc is going up in smoke. i hope the stupid fire burns itself out. welp, i better assign the new mayor to the mayoral quarters before they get pissy.  

oh, and the departing !!xxmayorxx!! knocked us below the population cap. apparently, mûthkat planktree desperately wants to reside here now for the purpose of entertaining citizens and visitors. heh.  

**final edit?** the stockpile fire is out. gethustfikod is still burning at 11000 degrees c. nobody got hurt except for the moody mayor. we lost some
masterwork cloth and some wooden gem bins. the gems themselves seem to be alright. the smoke has a clear vertical path to the surface only 2 z levels above so hopefully it will clear out.  

gethustfikod is still there. i can't q-x remove it and i can't designate it to be dumped. hopefully it's going to be like an adventure mode campfire and naturally go out after a while....  

oh you know what the moody mayor's profession was? a glazer. harshnessglazed. heh.  

**one week later**: i walled gethustfikod up and built a pretty chimney going up higher than any surrounding trees and rooftops. partway through construction, gethustfikod stopped burning. it looks like a stone coffer now that the smoke is gone. the !!xxmayorxx!!'s slab says she ""went missing"" and acknowledged her as the creator of gethustfikod.  

so we're pretty much back to normal. level 2 of the caverns has been breached and draltha is on the menu! lots of webs, fungiwood and spore trees to play with. the replacement mayor turned out to be the og mayor from the previous year. i like him. he's easy. he only mandates production of bolts, and we got those bitches on blast already. might even recommend him for a barony.  

oh, during the fun some blind cave ogres blundered some weapon trap leading up from the caverns. they died spectacularly. so many non-edible body parts to haul. maybe i should build a second atom smasher down in the caverns. "
339,"i'm currently playing adventure mode as a human vampire who lost complete control of his right arm early in his adventure(luckily though he's left handed). i had tried becoming a werebeast in order to heal myself, but ended up getting a vampire curse instead so i'm pretty much stuck with this. what i've been doing so far is just using a steel two-handed sword and getting the best armor i can find for my right arm(idk why). what i want to know is what kinds of debilitating injuries have you guys gotten, and did you have any creative ways of getting around them?"
340,"i was wondering, can you spread necromancy into other civs by making copies of necromancy books and selling them to merchants? mb giving them to travelling scholars?

342,"greetings. i'm currently on an adventure to max out as many skills as possible on my human adventurer. i'm here to share some tips on training skills.

note: you will be making a lot of macros. head to the wiki page if you don't know how to do this. also, open your init.txt and set macro delay to 1ms.

# combat

**weapon skills:**

&amp;#x200b;

find a relatively large animal. horses, bulls, goats, etc. all work great. use your weapon to stab, slash, or bash it's legs so it moves slowly. then, punch it in the limbs or use a non-lethal weapon to hit it's extremities until you get the message: ""the &lt;name&gt; gives in to pain."". now, use a crush attack on it's eyes to blind it. the animal will not run away or attack, since it cannot see you. it will walk a few tiles sometimes. now, set up a macro to hit it.

&amp;#x200b;

if your weapon is a spear, halberd, pike, or axe, you should use a less-lethal attacking style to hit it. slap with the axe or bash with the spear, halberd or pike. your training dummy is unlikely to die unless you accidentally hit it in the head due to a lack of skill. eventually, it will pass out again due to pain. you can either wait during this time, or train another skill while waiting.

&amp;#x200b;

note: for certain weapons, like whip/scourge and fists, it's possible to find a small animal like a kestrel, rabbit, or raven, and lash then in the neck. for whatever reason, the attack only bruises the skin or simply glances away. this is a fast way to train. needs more science to work out what weapons kill and what don't.

&amp;#x200b;

**unarmed:**

&amp;#x200b;

leveling striker, kicker and biter is similar to weapon skills. note that you can train striker and maybe kicker with the lashing method. for biter, it's the same as weapons, but bite them in the lower body instead of eyes. biting seems to cause relatively little pain.

&amp;#x200b;

**swimmer**:

&amp;#x200b;

find a long, straight river somewhere. these are quite commonly near villages. preferably have a bridge there as well.

swim long distances in the river. if you have at least novice skill level, you shouldn't drown. creatures may sometimes appear in the river. most fish swim away from you. if it's an alligator, crocodile, or other large amphibious animal, may armok have mercy on you. you are likely dead if you don't have armor. this is very unlikely, however. swimming under a bridge will make you drown for a short time. this is actually a good thing- it trains your toughness and endurance stupidly quickly. a macro can be setup for this as well.

&amp;#x200b;

**thrower/archer**

&amp;#x200b;

i'm grouping these skills together, since they are trained in conjunction. set up separate macros to grab stones, flowers, sand, or other small objects and to throw them onto the same tile as you are on. these are very quick skills to train to legendary.

&amp;#x200b;

**wrestler/fighter**

&amp;#x200b;

these skills are stupidly fast to train. simply enter sneaking mode, sneak up to some animal, set your {c}ombat preference to ""close combat"", and ram your face into them. you will grab and release them over and over again. you will become tired quickly, but just rest for a few seconds to regain your stamina. these skills are trained at roughly the same rate, so becoming a legendary wrestler will likely make a legendary fighter as well.

&amp;#x200b;

**ambusher/tracker**

&amp;#x200b;

press k to view tracks, and shift-s + s to enter sneaking mode, then walk over large amounts of land near villages or just in the wilderness. you mustn't fast travel if you wish to gain experience.

&amp;#x200b;

**dodger/armor user/observer**

&amp;#x200b;

you must have a set of armor for this. decent dodger level is recommended.

find a bunch of small animals. ravens, rabbits, buzzards, etc. if it's smaller than 10,000cm³, it's probably fine for training. grab as many as you can before they run away. high ambusher skill is recommended to sneak up to them.

they will attack you relentlessly, but mostly miss of have their attacks deflected by your armor. for whatever reason, you also gain observer experience from this. the more animals you grab, the faster you will gain xp. when you become tired, immediately stop by lying on the ground for a few moments while you regain your stamina. you must do a take-down on the animals, otherwise they will just struggle in vain against your grab, and won't fight. you can set up a macro to wait several times.

&amp;#x200b;

**shield user**

&amp;#x200b;

you must own a shield for this. do the same as above, but with only 1 animal. set up a macro to block the animal's attack constantly, then wait after. do this till' legendary.

&amp;#x200b;

**knapper**

&amp;#x200b;

set up macros for picking up stones, and removing them from your bag. then set up yet another macro for sharpening the stones. this is a quick skill, but obnoxious to train without macros. seems to improve focus and analytical ability attributes as well.

&amp;#x200b;

**persuader**

&amp;#x200b;

find someone to talk to. use the conversation menu to state your values, then find something they agree with you on.

create a macro to say that to them over and over again. repeat. trains linguistic ability, albeit slowly.

&amp;#x200b;

other skill training is still under studies. some skills seem nearly impossible to train at any decent speed such as climber, social/conversationalistic skills, butcher, carpenter, etc.

350,"hey folks, i've actually never started a game of df, but have watched a few friends play, and spectated the community from afar, so please forgive me if this topic is done to death.  
  
i'm wondering about the histories that arise in your playthroughs, if they ever present you with psychologically relevant synchronicities. it even seems like dwarf fortress could be a very useful method of divination. do the histories of your dwarfs ever coincide or compensate for events in your life?"
351,"as someone who plays dwarf fortress religiously, and has been for around a year and a half, i’ve taken to absolutely love adventure mode; possibly even more than fortress mode.

with the new villains update coming, i’ve seen a huge improvement in the game so far and it will surely benefit both fortress mode and adventure mode to implement villains into the game. at some point, cities will become more fleshed out than they are now, and as someone who enjoys slaying beasts and fighting bandits with even odds, i can say that i enjoy building a character up from a literal nobody into a folk legend. with this in mind, i thought about some other ways an adventurer could make a name for himself:

city arenas - an arena in town where townsfolk, wandering travellers, or existing champions participate in gladiatorial combat to earn the title of champion. thinking back to legends mode, i see a lot of “historical figures”: warlords that have slain thousands of men on the battlefield. wouldn’t it be interesting to see how your adventurer fares against an acclaimed warrior? my interpretation would be that your adventurer would start off fighting other peasants who want to make a name for themselves in the arena, and slowly gain more fame as more battles have been won (and maybe be rewarded with some prize money, too). when many battles have been won in one certain arena, champions from other towns or cities would travel to battle you, either lethally or non-lethally (training swords could be used in non-lethal combat, with “lightly tapping the target” being used as a points system, sort of like in fencing), and lethal combat could be either to the death or until one of the participants yield. 

while winning fights grants you fame, losing a fight shouldn’t decrease your fame (provided you’re still alive), unless a fight was lost against a peasant or a simple bandit. in doing so, i believe cities could be more expansive and would give an adventurer somewhere to fight without having to risk life and limb venturing to an ettin’s lair. 


player titles

until now, titles have been given when a creature manages to amass a somewhat impressive number of kills. the titles given are randomly generated, which makes them very... dwarfy. i feel like they could follow a more specific set of rules, such as the majority of kills you have being forgotten beasts, undead, etc. an adventurer could also choose their own title, but won’t be named as such unless they are known for their actions. 

perhaps, if an adventurer performs enough good deeds for the ruler of the city, they could be knighted, and receive a set of masterwork armour, the metal of which dependant on what civilisation you’ve been knighted in; dwarven = steel, humans = iron / gold (maybe?) and elven = grown wood (stupid treefondlers). 


duels 

as it stands, an argument between an adventurer and another sapient being does not lead to much in the way of resolution. however, if a conversation should upset a person enough, then they may challenge the adventurer to a duel (or vice versa). a duel must always take place outside, be lethal, and be performed with melee weapons. a duel could be used, i reckon, in a number of ways:

- as a more violent solution to a verbal conflict

- a way to prove your worth to more experienced warriors who refuse to travel with you (no more, “it is i that would lead you, but i have no need of your protection)

- if a crime syndicate has been mostly dismantled, a villain mostly foiled, etc, due to the player’s actions, then the villain / criminal overlord could enter a town and challenge you to a duel. 

- a way to start a fight with a bandit leader without the easy slaughter of his comrades. 

i feel as though this would bring an end to the sullying of reputation in towns, how starting any sort of fight now automatically renders you a ‘bad person’. additionally, to be perfectly candid, i feel as though being labelled a ‘killer’ for killing bandits isn’t necessary, and should most certainly not warrant everyone calling you as such. 


“want to know how i got these scars?”

this is somewhat tertiary, but whenever i play as an adventurer, he always sustains some sort of debilitating injury. my favourite story to tell is of my jaguar man, takuth nashonsoshosh (bloodyjackal) who became a fabled warrior through countless endeavours with bandits, goblins and beasts. he left his hamlet a peasant, and returned a victor. i won’t go into too much detail, but he was known across the continent for his bravery and martial prowess. however, after facing a dragon, his left eye was gouged out by its claws, leaving a vertical scar down his face. “fair enough.”, i thought, as he took down the dragon with a hearty swing at its head with his golden sword, an artefact by the name of asteshlim (cudgelwisp).

after killing the dragon and eating her liver for lunch, takuth ventured into a dark fortress, where he met a goblin warlord. blocking most of the blows with his shield, takuth saw an opening to stab the warlord’s chest. after a dodge from the warlord, takuth was open to attack, and with a swing from the goblin’s battle-axe, takuth’s left hand, the one wielding the shield that saved his life many times, had sailed off in an arc. pale from blood loss, i thought it was over. i never save scum because it makes for some interesting stories. i thought it was over, until takuth’s jaguar teeth found their way into the goblin’s neck. open to attack, the goblin managed to hack off takuth’s right leg, causing him to fall to the ground. after a few parries and shaking of the goblin’s neck, takuth ripped the goblin’s head off with his teeth. i always carry a crutch in case this happens, preferably iron or steel, and equipped it. takuth strapped the goblin’s head to his lower body (i imagined him wearing it on his belt), and managed to get back to the tavern i had him staying in (for free, due to the good deeds he’d done, which also came with free drinks). after i got back, i made takuth rest for at least a week, drinking and eating accordingly. i made him write a book detailing the journey, or mostly the ‘slaying of (goblin name)’. i retired him soon after as i wanted him to live in the tavern in peace. 

excuse the tangent. 

anyways, my point was that should you have an injury that alters your appearance, say a facial scar or a missing finger, or even hand, it could become a topic in conversation. it could reward you with fame for telling people that you had your eye gouged out slaying a dragon, granting you extra fame for ‘living to tell the tale’.


property and pets

after performing a few tasks for the ruler of a city, an adventurer should be able to buy or be rewarded a piece of property. in a player owned house, one can store their belongings, artefacts and weapons, without fear of being stolen. 

in addition, one may buy a horse, dog or other animal to accompany them. with the riding mechanic that has been previously talked about by toady, one should be able to purchase a horse after this has been implemented. alternatively, if a dog is bought it could join you on adventures, whether it be hunting or beast slaying. naming options could also be added, but the primary function is for companionship (and also getting rid of those annoying bogeymen).


anyway, i just thought i’d share some things i think i’d like to see added in the (likely not so near) future. let me know if you’d add anything else, and if you think my ideas could be improved. 

thanks :)"
352,"'how long has it been since the age of myths ended?

the battle of splattering assaults seemed as promising as it looked. but remember the other time we tried to invade the dark fortress ulnoarstruk? when we thought the fabled final battle were in our hands???

the day the demon imi deadcat gets unleashed into this world. fiereballs that incinerated our militia commander. those are armies that survived the goblin horde that destroyed fortresses of our twin civilisation, the ring of trade.

the battle that is supposed to end the vile force of darkness, turned out to end us. the demon tainted the dead to his own image. the darkfiends have a tainted miasma that turns dwarf insane over time of exposure. the best axe lords, falling to the cursed sight of corpses, sucuumbing from tantrums to insanity. when was the time where dwarven child could play hide and seek amongst goblin corpses without worries? none would believe such tales from the age of myths. soon it will just be travellers' tales, and the fortress of ebalkdol shall be left to the care of great armok.'"
353,"i got a reply from stephen burke from gn.

&gt;i know of dwarf fortress but have never played it. is there any built-in  or community-made benchmark? how would you propose testing it? we have  no familiarity with the game, so that makes it difficult to add to  testing. 

can we as the df community come up with a good benchmark that can pit cpus against each other in the game?

i know that many of us would like to see how the newest epyc 64-core would perform given its cache sizes.

354,"so i have wanted to get into dwarf fortress for a while not and i finally have, i started last weekend.  my first fort has has been going surprisingly well, or at least up until the part i'm about to tell you.  for three years my fort went fine and dandy, i thought i was going to die first winter but got lucky, and my area is in a hot climate so winter means literally nothing in this area.  for 3 years i didn't see a single enemy, i was surprised, no goblins, no sieges, i just got really lucky on my first fort.  i was honestly having a lot of fun, expecting to die real soon, by this point i've been board not knowing what to do having thought i would already be dead i didn't have any long term goals.  the only issue we had was some gray languars early on that stole our only copper axe and one of two copper picks.  shortly after caravan came but i had no clue how to work the trading system and didn't really have anything to trade as i had yet to find any ore.  we quickly overcame that once we finally struck ore, my one pick is being used be my now legendary +5 miner, and quickly began forging a boat load of them.  after a while a giantess and we promptly slaughtered it, by this point is when we were at around 140 dwarves.  problems began at the end of the third year, a human turned up, first human we have seen.  he was a were-llama.  i had recently set up 3 military squads with iron armour and weapons, but none of them were trained.  it took a bit but we killed the were-llama.  at this point i didn't know a dwarf could be infected.  i got lucky first round, after about a month a single dwarf turns and goes on a killing spree.  after slaying our brother and checking the extremely long list of combat logs, we lost about 50 dwarves by this point to the two were-llamas, previously only having 3 dead, all due to suicide, i discovered we had 6 possible infected dwarves and began construction on a containment chamber but we only had about 10 days to do it.  it was to late, 25 of granite, 4th year of the fortress, all 6 turn, and there was a massacre, a hasty burrow is made and alerted in one of the under construction rooms a level below.  all 6 llamas died but so many things happened the combat logs were wiped and i couldn't find out how many might be infected.  down to roughly 60 dwarves, it turns out only 2 got infected but the military is gone, the elven caravan just showed up, and mid battle some migrants show up, i'm now at 85 dwarves and waiting to see if any more turn, and if this fortress is even worth saving.

&amp;#x200b;

none the less i am proud of my first fort, and for being a first fort i learned a hell of a lot, and am ready to take on some more."
355,"i really like watching df streams, so if you know one or are one, please post his/your twitch/youtube user page, thanks. :)

edit: thanks for the replies! feel free to still recommend me more streamers, the more, the better."
356,"i have been a fan of df now for around 5-6 years and i often have spouts of returning, often with an update or a while since my last play. its the one game i come back to again and again because of its emergent nature. there are always a few issues that kill my vibe and desire to play, one of the big ones, and a classic one i assume for people is design and goals. when ever i start, i always look at the world and then think ""okay what do i do?"", i know how to play the game pretty well at this point, so learning isn't an issue but when it comes to fortress design, i have no clue.

&amp;#x200b;

i often have phases of design, whether its entirely spontaneous (sometimes a complete mess, sometimes i try something symmetrical or half planned and often fail) or i sit for 10, 20 or even 40 minutes at a time and pre-designate my fortress (and then proceed to just turn the game off because i have had my fill and in the end i always overlook something and it bugs me). what to do and how is always my big issue, i always have the urge to have an end goal so just embarking and digging a dining hall, some rooms and industry always feels rough and un-natural despite the fact that i would like it, when ever i do design something complex it is never as good as i want it to be and then turns me off playing, its a lose lose situation. 

&amp;#x200b;

does anyone else have this issue? i really want to just make a world, pick a site and then play, make something really fun and have some interesting experiences but now, not only do i know the game really well so the only difficulty is the harsh self imposed limits or gimmicks, but getting over that initial hump of an un-striked earth and 7 dwarves sitting on the surface with nothing to do. if anyone has experienced this or has some really interesting designs/forts/concepts then please share, you would be saving me.

&amp;#x200b;

also, if anyone has any mid to high level play guides/lets-plays or anything then link them, i always want to read/watch them but the only ones i ever find are the painfully slow low level guides or lets-plays that always begin on how to dig a 3x3 room into a mountain. "
357,"hey dwarfs!

i'm the guy who started a few months ago a let'splay series called mooncanyon, focused on storytelling and with a lot of production value, which, as you may know, is all narrated in spanish.

i'm here just to let you all know that the series has now english subtitles!
i've been hiring a translator since episode 2 and i plan to continue doing the same until the end, and see how it goes.

there are already 6 episodes out that you can watch right now, and the 7th is in production.
i hope you can go back and enjoy from episode one the whole thing subbed in preparation for the next episodes!

358,"i sent my dwarves to go pillage some elf village. thinking they would go down and around the long way from my fort since they are on the same continent, when they returned the report showed that they took it upon themselves to swim across the ocean to get there... anyone else seen something like this?

359,"(entirely default df, with only a few changes to the controls because i'm new)

adventure mode: the quiet shell, a land of savagery and filth.

**s**o in the last post i told you the story of how entante and morocanth (spider guy and a forgotten lobster with wings and fire breath). now here's about a season later

&amp;#x200b;

   **l**ate fall-ish. entante, now riding on the back of his pure luck tame (their still somewhat at odds but at least morocanth doesn't try to kill him) is able to make much longer journeys now that there's something keeping the bogeymen at bay.(the entire town he was in rejected going with him for blood and glory)

&amp;#x200b;

   **t**his time he treads into a small goblin refuge, which, unsurprisingly, lacked a military force of any kind. that of course, did not stop them from taking a giant fucking lobster that has wings and breathes fire as a threat, and immediately began mustering up what little combat force they had to try and kill it. lucky for me i spent a lot of time learning how to dodge and draw attention, because entante ended up becoming the center of attention while morocanth roasted everything else that moved. about 3 trolls, a beakdog, and 5 goblins later the whole place was ripped asunder from the sheer force of a crazy silk spinning, bob and weaving (get it?), axe swinging, mf pseudo dragon riding piece of shit and his eyeless, hairless, winged, many legged, flame-throwing lobster thats apparently a cannibal. entante spared every other type of sentient being unless they put up a fight, to which they were swallowed. he got a few scars and burns (got too close to a house) but got off without much trouble. morocanth went unscathed, as i guessed i couldn't heal him if i wanted to, so i had him play the role of artillery. another 5 in game hours pass before every goblin in the village is found, killed, butchered, and fed to the almighty morocanth. apparently forgotten beasts don't get phased by ghosts, and i managed to abuse that by using an elf as their scapegoat.

&amp;#x200b;

   **l**ooking at the loot i took every artifact and wound up with another axe (skyrim reference? sure i'll dual wield), a cool chestplate which i assume doesn't really help my combat, and a little book of life and death. i don't know where the hell these goblins got that from, but the blown up building half a day west looks like where it used to be. entante has yet to read the book. 

&amp;#x200b;

  **i** dont know where i'm going, but blood seems to follow now that my lobster got a good taste of it. that goblin city looks tasty, might just wipe out their smaller settlements. **army of 1 and a dragon wannabe!!!**"
