this ""weekly help thread"" will function similarly to /r/eu4's **imperial council**, but will not include all the basic information you can find either on [stellaris wiki](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/stellaris_wiki) (bear in mind that as of writing this the wiki is undergoing heavy rework due to 2.2 update) or via the [2.2 leguin update summary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/97yq2h/summary_of_dev_diaries_for_22_le_guin/) i am, however, going to include latest **patch notes** that relate to both **live** and **test / beta** branches of the game.

\----

**one simple rule**: when posting your question / tip or idea, please use this ""tag system"":

**\[help\]** \- for when you cannot seem to grasp how stellaris works and seek help from other space explorers

**\[bug\]** \- for when there is an issue with your game (include as much information as possible - screenshots, save files and / or logs)

**\[tip\]** \- for when you discovered something interesting about game mechanics that may not be obvious to a ""regular player""

**\[suggestion\]** \- for when you have this amazing idea on how to improve or change the game for better

example comments:

`[help] my galaxy is on fire and i forgot a key for an extinguisher`

`[bug] literally unplayable typo in the description of xyz`

`[suggestion] megacorp leaders need proper suits to look fancy af`

this way it will be easier for both players and devs (yes, they visit reddit as well!) to look up for any interesting information simply by using **search** (ctrl+f) function.

also, send (or tag) **general tips** directly to /u/termiaurthur so that he can put in the summary thread.

2,to establish a branch office!
3,"this is not a new idea, but it has become especially more important now. previous threads[^((1))](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/6f7jnp/splitting_civics_into_civics_and_origin/) have been calling for this idea for well over a year, but there are several mechanics in the new 2.2 patch that really make this necessary:  


if you play as life seeded, inward perfection, fanatic purifiers, syncretic evolution, mechanist, life seeded, post apocalyptic, or barbaric despoilers. you are locked to never use the corporate authority. likewise, criminal heritage can never become non-corporate. while this makes sense for some civics (criminal heritage and fanatic purifiers), it doesn't make sense for others: why can't a life seeded empire become corporate[^((2))](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a5l305/why_no_life_seeded_for_corporations/)?   


a separate ""origin"" at the start of the game would help address this issue. several existing civics would fall into this category. some might require starting civics as well. below is an updated version of the origins i pitched in a previous post[^((3))](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/7adu6b/suggestion_19_is_an_ideal_time_to_break_civics/), with a few edits to make compatible with the current state of the game.  


**origins** are mostly an early-game bonus or game change which gives limited bonuses at game startup. they cannot be changed, but they take the place of unchangeable civics. these do not change gameplay drastically, but provide flavor and changes to mostly early game, with some exceptions. examples:

1. **from the ashes.** this species recently recovered from an all-out war which set its' progress back substantially. before the decades long war, several colony ships were sent to various locations. what became of these colonies is a mystery, but reaching them is of utmost importance. starts with a population and building bonus on a typical planet. (start similar to united earth, with a guaranteed other empire w/ same species, but different ethos. empires have a relationship bonus with eachother.)
2. **lost colonists.** this empire started as a colony from an ancient world. with their pick of the galaxy, they get a larger homeworld with a buff to happiness, but it is treated as a colony for habitability purposes. they start as the same species as **from the ashes** similar to commonwealth of man, which would have this origin as default. opinion bonuses are granted between the two empires.
3. **ancient empire**. this species established a worldwide order long before developing modern technologies. because this order was so long lived, the government is far more advanced than otherwise thought. they start with 3 civics points, but changing civics requires +250 influence cost for reforming and limited to 2 civics per reform. this is reduceable with a technology researched in place of the +1 civic point research. tzynn empire adopts this origin.
4. **prolonged development.** for whatever reason, this species achieved sentience long before developing tools and society. as a result,  they have enhanced biological capabilities, but it will be more difficult for them to understand and manipulate them in the future. +3 biological trait points starting, but modifications will not be possible until this deficit is repaid by researching more biological techs. yondarim empire adopts this origin.
5. **environmental custodians.** this empire abhors negative impacts on their environment, and is very terraforming averse. but they are remarkably adaptable to make up for this shortcoming. starts with a larger population and the ability to build over some tile blockers (mountain ranges, kelp forests, glaciers, but not volcanoes, hostile fauna, etc), without the need to clear them. sclydari confederacy adopts this origin.
6. **friend-seekers.** this species united their civilization when they realized that radio transmissions from alien species were reaching their homeworld, and decided to try to find these alien species to befriend them. starts the game knowing the location of all spacefaring empires, including fallen empires. researching first contact gives them a larger influence boost, and they gain a relationship bonus with them. blorg commonality adopts this  origin.

**premium origins** would also be available with more substantial changes to gameplay. some of these would be new, but some of them are from previous premium content. some of them may require a starting civic for balance purposes, but that civic can be shed later while keeping the origin.

1. **altar of science.** \[included with utopia\] this species has sacrificed everything to gain knowledge. as a result, their homeworld underwent massive climate change. the species was adapted to (say) desert worlds, but can tolerate the arid world they have turned their home into. but with great sacrifice comes great reward: robots are nearly as numerous as organics, and the technology to build more persists. chinnorr stellar union adopts this origin. requires starting with a substantially reworked (but changeable) mechanist civic, which increases pops acceptance of robots and decreased their maintenance costs (energy and consumer goods).
2. **warrior traditions.** \[new, included with apocalypse\] the citizens of this empire have long sought glory wherever combat allowed it, and the space age presents new opportunities for this. planets have more defensive armies, and all stations build up to 3 free defense platforms with no maintainence. the kel-azan adopt this origin, as well as a **warrior traditions** civic which must be maintained for the defense platform enhancements.
3. **uplifted.** \[utopia\] this species was uplifted by another empire. it starts as a protectorate under a massive, but collapsing empire which will become fallen within 50 years. at that time, you will be liberated as the fallen empire recedes into stagnancy. you must be fanatic for their ethos, however you may select a 2nd ethos. you have access to the pre-sentient biological traits at start.
4. **syncretic evolution** \[utopia\] as currently implemented, but the civic is removed in favor of balance.
5. **awoken.** \[utopia\] start the game as an ancient group of aliens given robotic bodies in a new dawn, like the event chain.
6. **genetic castes.** \[new dlc?\] this empire had an early genetic age and applied their knowledge to create separate castes for warriors, financiers, and leaders. during setup, you get to establish 2 subspecies. the entire species must share 2 trait points, but the subspecies have flexibility on the remaining 3. ix-idar adopt this by default.
7. **fanatic purifiers \[utopia\]**  as currently implemented, with balance considerations. they also have new civics unique to this origin so that they can play more of an isolationist for some time, but are unable to ever engage in full diplomacy or become megacorps.
8. **gateway worshippers.** \[distant stars\] this species must start as fanatic spiritualist, with a choice for the third ethos point. they have a ruined gateway in their home system, and an increased chance of spawning the tech to reactivate it. they also have a higher chance of getting megastructure research to restore megastructures, as their obsession with celestial bodies makes their scientists think about them more often. this is loosely based on bajorans from star trek ds9.

**hivemind origins** are also premium content, requiring utopia.

1. **natural hivemind.** standard hivemind origin.
2. **devouring swarm.** a hiveminds species on this planet has subsumed all other life on their homeplanet, and now spreads beyond. replaces devouring swarm civic, with balance considerations.
3. **engineered hivemind.** an ancient empire took great pains to engineer this species from a primitive species. just like uplifted, this hivemind has access to primitive traits at game start and additional biopoints, and begins the game as a protectorate of a falling empire for 50 years. you also must have a biological trait called ""emergency switch"" which prevents your species from ever opposing your former masters, but can be removed lategame with a special project. (does not consume an extra civic slot)
4. **lost colonization unit.** starts as the same species as an advanced hivemind empire, which views you favorably, and may want to collaborate with you.
5. **neural interface.** (new) like syncretic evolution, the hivemind on this planet has evolved to manipulate lower lifeforms into performing its bidding. starts with additional pops of a prole species. *thanks to* u/termiaurthur *for the idea*

**machine empire origins** are also premium content, requiring synthetic dawn.

1. **nanite origin.** apparently, nanites from an ancient empire evolved on this planet and have terraformed it into a machine world. they then evolved into a sentient entity, which are remarkably flexible. start as a machine empire using standard machine gestalt civics. one fallen empire may have a relationship bonus with you.
2. **determined exterminators** as currently described, with balance considerations. requires special civic to be maintained.
3. **driven assimilators** as currently described, with balance consideration. requires special civic to be maintained.
4. **rogue servitors** as currently described, with balance considerations. requires special civic to be maintained.
5. **ancient relics** (new) this machine empire once served a great empire of organic beings. but due to some unknown galactic calamity, their creators' empire crumbled. much of their region of space consists of tomb worlds, with a few former colonies which reverted to bronze-age existence when the calamity struck. there may also be other ancient relic machine empires nearby, who similarly lost their history files in the calamity. the local cluster is littered with special events and megastructures. *credit to* u/alberto_da_vinci *for suggesting this*  


&amp;#x200b;"
4,"a lot of perks and what not have things ""we"" are doing, what ""a few of our colonists"" are doing, and ""our"" accomplishments. theoretically, a hivemind could view itself as a singular ""i"", with everything stemming from ""itself"". it would be cool for immersion.

&amp;#x200b;

similarly, instead of vir saying one of ""our"" science ships, it could be one of ""your science ships"".

&amp;#x200b;

or, even better, we could have a hive-mind synaptic node instead of a robot, and it would say ""my tendrils discover a suitable place on which i may grow further"" or something similar."
5,"when i get mid/late-game all my rural worlds start to fill up while my urban centers still have tons of jobs. this means i need to spend time manually resettling new unemployed pops to the right worlds. 

my idea is to just add a button next to resettlement that moves all unemployed pops from other planets to the selected one or some other migration mechanic to avoid a lot of pointless micromanagement every month. "
6,"so, we have 3 ascension paths.  psionic and biological come from society research. synthetic comes from engineering research. as you can see we don't have a physics one. what do you think an options might come from physics research? we could tern into something like unbidden. post your ideas in the comments!"
7,"many probably have discovered this by now, but i still want to share.

i have been frustrated with the new automatic sectors. not with how they function, which seems great. but with seeing each of these 1-3 planet sectors appear in the outliner. i just figured out how to correct that lol.

click on the outliner settings icon in the top right corner of the outliner (little cog wheel).  

there are many items checked in the options. in fact all but the first option is selected.

click on and select planets. click on and de-select sectors. presto, your outliner shows planets without the onesy twosy sectors.

hope this helps someone else as much as it did me lol.

"
8,viable strategy to keep yourself productive when the late game gets slow and laggy.
9,"le guin made me learn everything from scratch and i hated it. and when i finally get the hang of the new economy, this happens:

i made a shitload of custom empires, from genocidal butterflies to sentient hp printers, the galaxy was mostly mass effect empires (again, because i'm a nerd).
the first ones i met were the geth and for a machine empire they were surprisingly cool with sitting right next to organics, i think we even managed to sign one or two treaties.

quarians did not like it. they got mad, closed borders, started insulting me and finally, in year 2225 declared war, threatening to destroy me with their four corvettes. they had only one (pathetic) system and their defenses were a joke, so i thought ""why not, a free colony for me"".

worst decision in history. i won the war (obviously), grabbed their planet... and my economy crashed. that goddamn thing brought my monthly energy from 25 to -5, crime was sky-high and pops were on the verge of rebelling.

i sold this abomination of a planet to geth for some minerals as soon as they expanded enough to border it. 
"
10,"even back before 2.2, megastructures were kinda niche.

science nexus rush was pretty op, dyson spheres could *sometimes* be good and ringworlds were nice for expansions, but it came with a huge drawback.

*if you can afford to build megastructures, you've probably already won.*

this is further amplified by the insanely overpowered arcology/hive/machine worlds. 

so, what's the solution? this is a bit subjective, but this is how i would probably do it.

**drastically reduce the number of needed ascension perks**

change habitats to a technology, make mega-engineering no longer rare and reduce the cost of it and **make master builders let you build megastructures simultaneously**. that compresses (reasonably) megastructures to two perks - one of which is optional. unlike now, where you need to take all 3 to have a chance of reasonably building them in a decent time.

that would likely fix the issue of megastructures popping up too late and the frustration of only being able to build one at a time. but it doesn't fix the main issue, which is that they are excessively costly and take too long. my proposed solution is a tiny minimum build time (maybe less than a year), and a total build time that entirely depends on how many alloys/month you pump into it.

even if my solutions aren't perfect, there absolutely needs to be an overhaul to megastructures if they are to not be totally overshadowed by other new features in 2.2

"
11,"everything was going swimmingly in my first le guin playthrough, solid empire, 1st in the rankings behind the fallen dudes, and then i decide, screw it - lets give all my pops utopian abundance and theyll be really happy.

at first i was down -770cg per month. ok, i can deal with this. sell off my 24k of alloys over time while building civ factories to balance it!

civ factories need minerals and pops, miners turned into factory specialists, minerals went from plus 280 to minus 200. 

then it got bad. after living month to month it all ran out- food, energy, cg, alloys, all of it. tried everything, selling systems for major injections, doing anything to kickstart the economy...

but to no avail. i turned back after 10 years to welfare but it wasn't enough. nobody wanted to work in the fields or the mines or even the factories. the entire economy collapsed, and i resigned as ceo.

moral of the story - don't write cheques that your pops cant eat."
12,"it seems to me that pops are too easily swayed to xenophilia. unless that alien over there is a slave, is attacking you or is just plain ugly, you are liable to start liking it. this is a problem.

i think it could add an additional challenge to multicultural empires if your pops had a chance of reacting negatively to aliens.

perhaps it could be tied to some traits.

for example:

* sedentary and solitary pops may be annoyed at seeing xenos move in on their territory.

* traditional pops may be threatened by the disruption to the natural order.

* quarrelsome pops may be slow to trust aliens.

it could also be caused by pops with opposite traits interacting with each other:

* weak pops may feel threatened by strong pops. strong pops may bully weak pops.

* conservationists may dislike the wasteful and how they trash their environment.

* conformists may dislike deviants and how they never seem to quite fit in.

overall, i think new interactions between your pops would add to the realism and immersion of this game. right now, it seems like pops are all too eager to get along with each other, unless the government tells them that being xenophobic is really in this year.

thoughts?"
13,"1.) interstellar assembly

18.2 years build time. +50 opinion modifier with anyone in the galaxy and +100% immigration pull. if pop growth is the single most important thing in every play-through of 2.2, than this megastructure is extremely valuable and realistic to see the light before the end of the game.

&amp;#x200b;

2.) strategic command center

24.5 years build time. this thing gives you +15% sublight speed, naval capacity, more starbases, and defense platforms. a must have for anyone that's playing on the largest galaxy setting.

&amp;#x200b;

3.) matter decompressor

31 year build time. gives 1k minerals per month when completed. basically the mineral version of a dyson sphere. better than a dyson sphere solely on the fact that you'll finish this thing quicker. and unlike energy, minerals are a rarer resource that become more important the less habitable planets your empire ends up with.

&amp;#x200b;

3a.) mega art installation

18.2 build time. +300 monthly unity and +15% amenities for all planets. a realistic choice for empires having trouble keeping their pops(or themselves) happy, or looking to demolish an amenity building or two. no planet can become specialized with unity, so a plus 300 monthly modifier can mean a lot to empires without that many planets to use throughout the game.

&amp;#x200b;

\[-4-\].) science nexus

24.5 years build time. \[300/330\] research across the board(depending on if you get the brain event) \[*and* you get up to +15% research speed\]. you can easily beat this with a single planet specialized for science production, but the research speed makes this thing worth it.

&amp;#x200b;

5.) sentry array

25 year build time, gives full sensory data on the galaxy.  eh. it's okay for those who really need to know what your opponents are doing.

&amp;#x200b;

\[-6-\].) dyson sphere

55 year build time. 1k monthly energy when completed. despite the build time, 1k energy is still amazing.

&amp;#x200b;

10.) habitats

5 year build time. like, what? six to eight max districts and no ability to build housing, science, or amenity buildings-*unlike planets.* mainly only useful to be specialized as fortress, foundry, strategic resource,  consumer good, or even food production habitats. better than ring worlds, if only because you can rush to get them out before 2300.

&amp;#x200b;

7.) ring worlds

58.33 years to complete. 50 possible housing, farming, or generator districts, can build normal buildings, but can not build any mineral districts. realistically these things are mainly worth it to help you fully switch all your normal planets to mining worlds. not being able to build mining districts really decapitates the value of ring worlds. 'course, who's to say you can't just go all into energy production and spend all of it on monthly mineral trades on the market?

&amp;#x200b;

(build time is without taking into consideration mega engineering, the living metal edict, and the mega structure unity ambition.)

&amp;#x200b;

edit: updated science nexus' position."
14,"right now, if you get into the late game while playing a tall or moderately-sized empire, and start to run out of room for districts and housing, the pops still keep growing. often, the only way around this is continued creation of new colonies and moving the excess pops there, which often defies the point of playing tall in the first place.

other empires that are authoritarian can implement population controls to stop growth, make some unemployed pops slaves and sell them, or exile the excess pops. however, if you're playing pacifist or egalitarian, often your only option is the discourage growth, which not only hurts you on the consumer goods side but also doesn't really prevent growth as much as slow it down.

what i'm asking for here is pretty simple. a mid to late-game tech that gives you the planetary option to ""enforce family planning"" or ""encourage replacement rate reproduction,"" that will cost influence but stop pops from growing on the selected planet, allowing you to avoid an unemployment spiral while also not turning your egalitarian pacifists into slavers.

not a game breaking issue but definitely adds a ton of clicking to the game to repeatedly transfer unemployed pops to new planets, which is something i believe 2.2 was trying to prevent in the first place."
15,"[well...](http://prntscr.com/lwf4nk) i don't know what to say.. i spawn next to these guys, not even a month in and they want me to basically cede my homeworld because i spawned next to them. it's great, i've never lost a run so fast. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm not sure whether i actually want this fixed or not honestly. "
16,"playing as a machine gestalt, i began to settle my first ringworld section. i set all my full planets to drone production in order to fill the ringworld. manually relocating all those pops is a chore. it would be nice to have a way to automate it."
17,"it's pretty clear that mes aren't what they used to be, but how do the various special me civis fair? here are my thoughts after having tried them in 2.1

rs are the worst haha. you get all the disadvantages of a bio race such as food, consumer goods, habitability etc but almost none of the benefits. sure you have unity but no bellies are fed by good feelings. there are some small advantages though. you can completely eliminate the use of redundant coordinator jobs and happy bts on that planet also provided some stability bonus for a small boost. you also unlock building slots faster but you won't have the robots to work them so it's a mixed blessing. in 2.1 the servitor morale was a powerful but annoying to micro mechanic that lead to rs only being slightly behind others in economy for a massive unity boost, a good tradeoff. in 2.2 you get a massive unity boost but an ungodly upkeep cost for the bts. you should probably enact pop controls sooner rather than later, but if you don't use bts then why take the civic at all?

next are normal mes, people have already made extensive analysis on their new 2.2 problems so i won't go over them again. the short of it is slow growth, massive energy costs, a need for constant expansion, etc. you need pops to grow but then need resources to support them but to get resources you need pops. 

de are still strong actually. turns out having a total war cb makes a lot of things a lot simpler hahaha. now are they stronger than other genocidal species? that's up for debate. being able to have diplomacy with other machine races is a decent advantage, but that's very rng dependent.

now the strongest by far in my opinion are the da. growth is king and with cyborgs you pretty much double your pop growth. also cyborgs are better than normal bio pops but you don't need consumer goods! it's like the opposite of rs, all the benefits but only half the problems. plus the assimilation cb is pretty good too. da have always been strong and 2.2 doesn't change that. in some ways they might be stronger because fast g
rowth lets you unlock buildings quickly and unlike rs they'll have the pops to work them. "
18,"i'm playing an inwards perfection run right now. one of my neighbours kept declaring wars on me so at some point i got fed up and actually took a couple of their systems, splitting their territory in two. it looks like they are running trade routes through my territory since i have pirates spawning nowhere near my own trade routes and the trade route map mode shows heightened piracy risk in some of my systems near the border.

this really breaks immersion. why would my inwards perfection empire tolerate alien traders within my borders? there should be a way of denying access to foreign trade routes. in fact, i see no reason why this shouldn't be tied to closed borders. if i closed my borders to an empire this should automatically imply that i don't allow their trade routes.

on a related note, it would be very useful to be able to adjust the actual routes. sometimes making a slight detour could save one or two starbases."
19,"i personally like how alloys have been added to the game, but i think it was executed properly.  after playing two games in 2.2 i find myself shying away from space battles, especially in the early game.  i find that i'm asking myself, 'i have 10 corvettes to their 5 corvettes, i will win this battle, but if i lose 3 corvettes, that's 300 alloys \[...\] 300 alloys takes two of my metallurgists:  2 years, 900 minerals, 50 food, 50 energy, and 50 consumer goods to produce.  is this really a victory?'  i know a lot of people have suggested scaling up alloy production or removing alloys entirely, but i think this would work even better (as it would incentive successful space battles and give construction ships more of a purpose).

* every space battle leaves salvage, which is issued as a special project e.g. **special project: salvage in sol system**
* construction ships can recover 50% of the alloys lost in battle (75% if recycling campaign edit is in effect and more % though technology advancement)
* construction ships have an auto-salvage option (similar to a science ship's auto-explore option) so you don't have to micro manage every salvage project
* construction ships can have a designated military escort (the escort fleet that will follow them, protect them during salvage projects, and prevent other construction ships from conducting salvage projects within its current system)

if alloys worked as described above, then i would be saying to myself, 'i have 10 corvettes to their 5 corvettes, i will win this battle, even if i lose 3 corvettes, i can still recover 400 alloys in this system which i can use to build 4 corvettes.'"
20,"first real playthrough of stellaris ever. i’m a fanatic purifier me and i just destroyed two ai’s to my north. holding their stuff put me stupid over the admin cap (like 4x my cap i believe) so i destroyed everything that wasn’t a planet with pops on it after. i’ll destroy my stations on their planets once i’m done using their pops as batteries. is this what you’re supposed to do, or should i just be ignoring the admin cap and spamming more research planets?"
21,"i'm trying to come up with an empire based on the ancients of atlantis from stargate. traits, civics and government. anybody got some ideas?"
22,"so a planet of slaves successfully rebelled and broke away. i'm going to crush them obviously and i want to exterminate them, but not entirely, is the option of individual pop execution still a thing?"
23,"i'm starting to get refugee bursts from a nearby warzone and need some way of venting the excess pops easily. i don't mind if they don't work, my economy can tank that, but until i colonise enough new planets to house them, is there any easy way to deal with them?"
24,so i have just hit late game and boom the performance issues i feel like have gotten worse since 2.1. can anyone else confirm this?
25,"right now in stellaris, there is really no way to expand your naval capacity outside of fitting starbases with anchorages. we seem to no long get a passive gain from just pops in general. using precious building slots on strongholds is almost a non-starter, and the techs that directly enhance naval capacity come late and expensively. and having trade added to the game really stresses your fleet capacity and your starbases, so even more of your cap is taken up by corvettes on continuous patrol and you have less of it to begin with since more modules need to be devoted to trade and trade protection.

one thing that does seem to help is when a megacorp sets up a mercenary liason office on one of your worlds, and that +3 naval capacity really does help. i'm really surprised there aren't really more ways to add more soldier pops besides that branch office so i purpose a new edict: mobilization level, representing how militarized your society currently is.

my initial framework would go like this:

disarmed nation: as now
volunteer only: +1 soldier pop per 50 on planet (minimum 26, new slot at 76, 126, 176 etc)
limited conscription: +1 soldier pop per 25 (minimum 13, new slot at 38, 63, 78 etc)
extensive conscription: +1 soldier pop per 15 (minimum 8, new slot at 23, 38, 53, etc)
service by requirement: +1 soldier pop per 10 (minimum 6, new slot at 16, 26, 36, etc)

right now, there is really no reason to ever not be at your maximum naval capacity in the base game. ship upkeeps are reasonable, and every ship in the fleet has a deterrent effect. but given different strategic situations, your mobilization level could change. every soldier is a drain on the economy, since they are still consuming goods and food and producing nothing but naval capacity and defensive armies. you need to pick guns or butter, as most governments throughout history needed too. and this choice of guns or butter could motivate the pacifist and militarist factions. pacifists probably don't want anything more than a volunteer army, while militarists would want some sort of conscription to keep the army strong. also events could be based around your mobilization level (“hell no we won't go!”)

this is also an opportunity to give a little more weight to underpowered civics, like citizen service and warrior culture, and traits like strong, resilent, and very strong, things no one takes except for role-playing reasons. having these civics and traits directly buff soldier pops would make them more viable if soldiers are more common on worlds. say warrior culture also reduces the upkeep on soldier pops as well as reducing the cost of armies. or strong increases the 'output' of soldier pops with its naval capacity. i've really liked the civics like technocracy and merchant guilds that change how you value certain buildings and pops, and giving soldiers a more prominate role would push these underulitized traits into at least consideration.

really the only downside that i see is that this makes invading heavily populated worlds require lots more resources and actions to keep troop transports safe and effective during a war. normally adding gameplay would be a good thing, but right now, ground combat and shepharding your armies from planet to planet isn't the most compelling gameplay in the world. still, it would more satisfying to have your gene warriors, warforms, and xenomorphs have a worthy opponents that requires their services and having a strong offensive ground army is more than just a rp consideration. maybe also having a delay on how long it takes to 'train' defensive armies, so as soon as any war is declared, a bunch of defensive armies don't just appear from nothing, as fresh troops will need training and equipment before they are battle ready.

plus, the ai has to be aware of how its mobilization level will effect its economy, and considering how it has dealt with it in 2.2 so far, that maybe that's a bigger ask to keep the computer from crashing its economy by adding non-materially productive pop.

i'm honestly surprised that nothing like this is already in the game, but i hope it will be in the future. "
26,because reasons!
27,one of my friends is debating buying stellaris and he asked me to sell it to him. how would you guys promote the game in one sentence or less?
28,"what strategy would be best for this combo? would it be more advantageous to ditch pacifist for fanatic spiritualist?

so basically i want to take the mind over matter perk, purge and enslave aliens, and also have a huge empire administration. my space elves know they are the most superior civilization to ever exist. 

anyone else play this combo?"

31,"i am pissed. i did not won the galactic market even if my bid was ""exceptional"" and i was doing far more trade than the empire who got it. by far more i mean my capital was doing 50% more trade than its capital and in total i was doing more than double his trade.  anyone knows the algorithm for assignment of the galactic market?

32,"it's very basic so far. you enter the folder with all the saved games in it, then add the folder where you want them backed up. then it backs up every ten minutes while you're playing.

please try it out and let me know what you think!

33,"so, the basic idea is this - because resort worlds have 100% habitability, half of the population being clerks and, most importantly, not using admin cap for districts, you can use them with shared burdens or utopian abundance to generate something using a lot of unemployed pops! and with clerk jobs they generate by themselves the planet can be self-sustained, with the exeption of maybe food. but you can make food on other planets and even starbases.

that means that the only things you care about now are consumer goods - so your planets can support themselves, and maybe even break even, and housing - so you can cram more people in a single planet. so technically the traits are set - environmentalist and byzantine bureaucracy in goverment, communal and conservationist in pop traits. maybe also inteligent if we are going utopian abundance.

so basically a nation dedicated to blowing raspberries on awesome worlds in awesome houses.

but then what do i even pick for goverment ethics? technically f.materialist should be great, but does extra research from them affect unemployed pops? maybe xenophobe instead for pop growth speed?

also, how quickly do uneployed pops generate crime? i am a bit concerned with exessive need in enforcers. maybe police state instead of environmentalist?

and, most importantly - how do i even name an empire like this? and who would they be? a bunch of peacocks dedicated to looking nice?

maybe there are more and better ideas on how to do this? and yes, i fully understand that this isn't by far the best build. but it sounds fun and it sounds like it can work, so i'm willing to try. thanks everyone in advance for help!"
34,"what special privilege does the market leader have, i had one empire get the spot before i nominated one of my best planets, but i haven't noticed anything different from the local market. am i missing something?"

37,"everyone seems to be going on about how growth is king. here's a few thoughts.

1. it's not strictly growth that you want so much as more pops to work more buildings.

2. you want to shorten the interval between gaining each new pop.

3. nihilistic aquisition is freaking op.

4. biological ascension is possibly the best ascension perk now.

---

my reasoning is as follows:

1. high growth is nice, but more pops is nicerer, and not needing to worry about resources *at all* is nicerest. basically i'm saying that having 30 extra minerals/food/energy *right now* is far better than having one extra pop over 130 months. 130 months of extra minerals can translate into a lot of built ship either via the marketplace or via foundries (possibly even both if you're lucky or are a hive mind).

2. shortening the growth interval is incredibly easy - you have basic traits (weakest), migration (weakish), tech and building bonuses (stronk), building robots (stronker), and just straight up stealing or buying pops (op af). this in my opinion makes it very much worthwhile to ditch (the very expensive) growth traits in favour of powering through the early game to get either those sweet sweet tech bonuses and robotic pops, or just stealing every sentient being you come accross. incidentally the empires which can build and grow pops at the same time are incredibly powerful right now (mechanists, and driven assimilators)

3. park your fleet in orbit. steal the enemy pops. literally the only thing you need to worry about is stability. and even then if you're processing them in some way that can become irrelevant. infinite food/energy/minerals here i come! the baseline for this is that it frees up your native pops (custom built etc etc) to become 100% specialists (if you're authoritarian), and the new aquisitions can be whatever you want them to be - food, batteries, slave workers, footstools, whatever. by cutting out that pesky ""growth"" phase you can reap massive benefits. tbh this single ability deserves its own post.

4. you know all those negative traits you took at the beginning? you can get rid of them. easily. biological ascension lets you make everything *perfect*. xeno pops become perfect resource gatherers, native pops become glorious rulers, other empires will look on in envy at your noble enlightened peoples (never mind that you turned a bunch of them into literally cattle, and others into *very pretty* footstools). this tweaking accross *whole swathes* of your social strata makes you laugh at silly things like ""not enough housing"" or ""low amenities"".

---


basically. fuck immigration, fuck innate growth. steal pops, enslave them, grow stinking rich on the proceeds of their deaths/labour/tears/etc.

nihilistic aquisition and raiding stance are the most powerful things in the game as of the current patch. hands down, no argument."
38,"hi! 
i stopped playing stellaris for over a year. got excited and bought the 3 expansions that came out and wanted to try them out. however after pressing „play“ in the launcher, the game doesnt work anymore/crashes instantly. no matter what i select! no mods installed and the game worked very well when i played it the last time. anyone has any idea what is causing this ?"
39,"in pre-megacorp, i complained that playing on grand admiral was no longer a challenge. for reference, i have some 150+ hours played. with this version though, it seems i fail even on admiral (tried a few grand admiral runs, realized i'd just try it easier and now struggling with admiral to the point i'll go even easier for the next game)

&amp;#x200b;

i don't feel like not coping with the new economy, though it certainly may be the case - but it feels more about everything from expansion to extermination is heavily tied to economics, and it's all heavily taxing. and since ai gets quite substantial resource bonus, it's no longer a cakewalk to fight even a single empire now. my last game i tried driven assimilators with pop-growth mods, expanded like crazy, and then three nearby spiritualist empires just deleted me.

also, as it's all tied with economy so much, taking a few important planets is able to totally collapse your economy beyond any hope for comeback...

&amp;#x200b;

do you guys feel the same, or is it just me playing extremely sub-optimally in the new economics?"

so, no point in wasting ssd space with this :)

42,"pretty simple really. currently, pops in an empire with allowed migration will settle \*anywhere\* in the empire, even planets that have 10% habitability. what this means is you can end up with your xenophile empire being filled with pops on planets that they are totally unsuited for, eating a grossly disproportionate amount of resources for doing so. (+90% food and amenities usage really adds up over like 100 pops)

anyone else experienced this or feel it needs adjusting? perhaps pops should only tend towards planets that they actually want to live on? it's currently maddening, particularly when i have forced relocation disabled so can't move them back to planets that aren't actively poisoning them."
43,"so i've seen some rumblings along the lines of posts and in game tooltips that suggest the existence of a market run the the empires in the game and not just the buy/sell internal market, but i haven't been able to do much with it. i suspect that this is due to my game having a fanatic xenophobe who hates my guts in control of the galactic market but i can't be certain. anyways, what is it?"

47,"for those who do not know or have not noticed, there is a slider that adds or removes guaranteed habitable worlds in your settings (changing it does not disable achievements). what this does is ensure that when you spawn into a new game, there is planets nearby that match your planetary preference equal to the number listed on the slider. 

example: if i have arctic worlds as a preference, and i have 2 guaranteed habitable worlds set as my slider, there will be 2 other arctic worlds within a few jumps of my starting home system. now, don't get me wrong, this is good. it ensures that people can't be screwed and have no surrounding habitable worlds around them. 

&amp;#x200b;

issue: this works with life-seeded. if you select life-seeded as one of your civics, and you have your guaranteed habitable worlds slider set to say 2, then you will have 2 guaranteed gaia worlds spawn near your start.

this completely breaks the life-seeded civic. the play style of only having one gaia world was balanced with the chance of having more but with the big possibility that until habitats you would only have 1 planet. with this, you can have much more. not sure if this is a bug or not, but play it while you can i guess. "
48,"i feel like the tradition could need some mutual exclusive pathes. right now you only decide the order of the traditions, but at the end, every empire will have the same.

if i remember correctly, civ 5 had the double amount of traditions, but you could only pick half, making choices in which direction your civilization would go.

this could be traditions having focus like peace/war, tall/wide, exploration/production... 

what do you think? "
49,"seeing the crazy high numbers of mineral/energy space resources inside enemy borders only to conquer it and realize it's actually just half of these numbers sucks. what's worse, unless you remember what difficulty you're playing at and what modifier that adds, you can't be sure what the value will be once you take the system."

i have two alloy foundries, each providing two metallurist job slots for a total of 4. i upgrade one to a mega-forge, giving me +3 slots for a total of 7. i demolish the other foundry to free up a building slot, resulting in a total of 5 metallurgist job slots. i'd expect to have the 4 pops previously employed in the foundries to be happily working in the mega-forge, right?

wrong. only 2 jobs are filled and i have 2 pops unemployed, waiting to be demoted to a lower stratum. what?"
55,"apparently 740 hours is a long time to spend on a videogame over the span of 2 years, thank you paradox for making such an amazing game! like others, i'd like to offer up some of my observations, as well as a few bugs that i've noticed (new and old), as well as a few *unique* vanilla exploits you may not have been aware of.

heavy spoiler warning: (mods, can you do the thing here?)

in no order at all:

my last playthrough was an attempt to make empire that would reclaim the l-cluster and install one of each megastructure there. after studying the horizon signal event code i figured it could be possible to wormify one of the systems and make a matter decompressor on the new black hole.
result:

-failed exploit/bug: the game doesn't recognize it as a black hole, despite the celestial class change

-bug: when in the galaxy map, the system is always still visibly a star (i figure you already knew this)

-massive exploit/bug: i figured out that you can wormify cracked planets back into tomb planets, this is tested to work and i have a system with 8 tomb planets (124 size total) in the cluster. fun.

-bug?: the wormified planets have no agri/mine/generator district slots, so unless they are going to be ecumenopopopopolis's or financial/tech/trade planets, they are hard to use.



i got a visit from the cache, then it came back and did its thing, i feel like people don't get this event often and i've only gotten it once before, so it doesn't get looked at very close.

-bug: since at least the last update in 2.1, the trait has a text that says ""this trait gives leaders special stuff etc..."" it doesn't.

-bug: the research bonus from the uplifted trait is either not working or not shown in 2.2. unless the trait does not affect already hired researchers, which may explain why i didn't notice it, but i figured it would.



exploit: the brainslug event is fun, unless you're a xenophobe/inward perfectionist...or maybe not! so this issue highlights a bigger problem with ethics shifting but here is how i exploited it (i've done this three times now):

my empire: spiritual/xenophobe/pacifist (gaia,inward perfectionist) (also works if pacifist is something else)

step 1: get the brain slugs anomaly and the old gods event chain, and 500 influence

step 2: suppress xenophobic ethos until its the minority

step 3: use old gods to shift fto fanatic spiritual/pacifist

-at this point, inward perfectionist is inactive, (but unremovable, more on this later) and you can do some diplo stuff too

step 4: do brain slugs, embrace into citizens

step 5: embrace xenophobe and tada! inward perfection again without the 10 year wait and additional 500 influence


the bigger issue is when something like the war in heaven comes along and you side with an awakened empire:

-bug: the ethos change can deactivate civics like the inward perfectionist and prevent removal of that civic or ethos shifting


another problem with shifting occurs when you get the chosen one and transform your government to make them immortal ruler.

-massive exploit: transforming your government for the chosen one allows you to wipe any civics that are suppose to be permanent like life seeded, then reform your government civics after to be whatever you'd like.

-bug: i was able to make s875.1 waveform my immortal chosen one ruler once... imagine that, a immortal psychic robot.


other misc bugs:

mid game - marauders:

-bug: marauder empires won't bug you if you never bother to learn their language.

-bug: did they learn your language first? well now you can research them anyway and get free influence

-bug: raiding fleets freeze if there are inhibitors at every route into your system, i figured this out after a raiding fleet took 60 years to reach me.

-bug: instability in inhibitors on stations: that marauder fleet only reached me because jerry from engineering on the kerbol staton fell asleep on the inhibitor button. (sometimes they randomly turn off)


war in heaven:

-exploit: (please leave this in) empires that usually cannot form an alliance are able to lead non-aligned powers

-massive bug: for as long as war in heaven has existed, i have never seen it naturally end without player intervention. why: because fallen empires don't know how to land armies and after a while they just stop producing them, meanwhile allying armies are just standing by while one empire fallen empire fleet bombs the shite out of another endlessly. i've seen this happen at least 6 times. the only time i've ever seen a wih *approach* a conclusion is when one empire has a colossus... until it's destroyed of course and they don't bother to build another.

-2.2 bug: when megacorp empires are made into thralls or whatnot it locks them out from making or breaking commercial packs/research agreements because they lose independence. you'd think i should be able to end a pact with someone or a research agreement.

-2.2 bug: similarly with criminal megacorps, it seems they still have an immunity when they are in wih and at war with you/your awakened empire. they still wont get off my lawn despite being hostile.


endgame:

-ui bug: please, please, please make the unbidden and prethoryn like 6 iq points smarter or dumber. since this game came out they have gotten fleets stuck in this endless loop where its rapidly changing the target system that they are headed to and never move their fleets. i think the easiest way to fix this is to put a lock on their orders so a fleet's intentions can survive a few jumps before changing, unless attacked.

-user bug: user keeps playing after victory without stopping, highly addictive, pls patch


2.2 bugs:

-bug: terraforming into gia worlds deletes districts

-bug: the planetary prospecting edict works 75% of the time (yes im aware its not supposed to make rare resources(unless it is?))

-bug: abandoned coordination centers that aren't over a capital wont work

-bug??: the dimensional portal.... is it supposed to do something aside from give me physics? it seemed like you guys had a very interesting narrative setup

-bug??: -how the hell do you dispel criminal megacorps. it seems after coming back to a planet the 3rd time they just stay for good even with 100% stability and 0% crime.

-bug?: where did the zro go, i've only seen it after the ice ice baby anomaly and follow up question: what does zro do now? bc the shroud is 1000e flat.

-bug: techs gained from salvaging caravan ships aren't actually gained, they are just 100% researched and often require 1 more month to finish

-bug: i got nanite transmutation fro old with defects, is that suppose to be possible?

-bug: it appears in early game it is sometimes possible to ask a curator to point out a mystery and nothing happens, nothing added to situation log (also i think energy is not expended too)

-bug: the game can seemingly route your military fleets through unexplored wormholes as long as you have the tech to travel through them

-bug??: admiral experience from battles is nearly insignificant now, was this intentional?


2.1 bugs still in the game:

-bug: finally got the cryopod warrior anomaly, nothing happened after researching it

-bug: the abandoned ship with all the dead scientists-anomaly: if you quickly swap out the leader he doesn't die.

-exploit: you can usually go to the isolated system and do the anomaly without confronting the psionic entity

-bug: the sea of consciousness anomaly is repeatable apparently if you keep rebuilding a station.


annoyances:

-scientist that specialize in ancient civilizations: after you find the homeworld can we assign them to work at a starbucks or somewhere where their college degree would be more useful?

-exploit: the freaking first league's ecumconoennopolis is massively op, and now that the internet knows where it'll spawn i would recommend disallowing colonization until the antigrav tech at least. or randomizing the civilizations.

-jobs lost and gained from branch offices leaving are stupid, they can shift a lot of employment.

-promote growth should be continuous and/or scale according to the population, like nutritional penitude policy but per planet.

-enecumenopolopolis is very funny and difficult to pronounce, pls patch

-(exploit) its infinitely cheaper to swindle any empire out of 5k alloys than to buy on the market, youd think theyd want to hold on to their alloy more.

-there should be an easier way to get the engineer trait

-not being able to customize or upgrade event ships

-bubbles can die, pls patch


and of course:

-why can't you terraform the nanite worlds if you get grey or l-drakes???


and finally: my closing comments:

2.2 is incredible and playing tall is more fun than ever: i love that i can dominate with such little space and allow the galaxy to war in the background. i actually appreciate nerfing things like the speed demon anomaly and the agrarian idyll civic (which i heavily abused to pump out unity in 2.1). i wish there was a bit more narrative going on after mid game, when (especially for peaceful empires) i'm just building megastructures and going around to make sure the encourage growth modifier is checked every few years. i feel like before mid game i'm driven by the impending kahn crisis if i have a marauder nearby, constantly building up my defences for that, but after that and wih the galaxy is a little boring unless you go into conquest mode. 


i hope someone at paradox sees this, i appreciate you and this game immensely. i'll post these bugs in the forms at some point too.

56,"hi guys!

&amp;#x200b;

2.2 and megacorp have been released for nearly two weeks, and even though i now work and have been sick for a few days, i've managed to work a bit on my mod, [expanded hive minds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1594148622)!

some of you may have played on its previous version, but for those who didn't, the goal of the mod is to greatly enhance the gameplay and flavour of hive minds.

the 2.2 patch greatly improved hive minds, which i'm very happy of since i love them, but luckily there are still some stuff left for me to mod!

&amp;#x200b;

not everything from the previous version has been updated yet, as i'm rewriting nearly everything.

&amp;#x200b;

for now, the first big feature updated is the infestation.

the infestation allows you to integrate species into your hive mind without having to genetically alter them. this is not for free however, as every infested pop (including your own at start!) require more housing space, and have a higher food upkeep. the leaders, if the species can produce them, are also affected, by lowering their experience gain, and increasing their cost and upkeep.

you can improve your infestation through technology, making the drawbacks less intense, and even making your pops better in the end.

&amp;#x200b;

some other flavour is already included, as a handful of civics, and the ability to choose what your unemployed drones produce (minerals or food).

&amp;#x200b;

i'll try to port the lacking mechanics (mainly the symbiosis and the protector of the organics) as soon as possible, but as i said i now have to work so it'll be slower than when i first launched the mod.

&amp;#x200b;

hope you'll like it!

as always, if you have any bug to report, or any suggestion to make, feel free to do so below!"
57,"so, we know the basic vanilla primitives observation mission like passive observation, active observation, infiltration, indoctrination, and enlightenment, right?

but other than these missions, i guess we can add another one, like periodically harvesting the primitives into food, capturing interesting specimens for amenities *wink wink*, recruiting militaristic primitives into your army, convert primitives into your faith, transforming primitives into hats (consumer goods)......

so any redditors with excellent or depraved idea in mind?"
58,"right now you get spammed with war requests every 2 seconds. and if you keep declining their opinion goes into -1 trillion instantly it's so dumb.

this must be a bug. no way can the intended behavior for a new war request to come in every 3 seconds."
59,"since i've cracked this now after a couple playthroughs let me teach you how to 2.2, as stellaris is very different now.

first of all, if you're new to 2.2, you've probably noticed that all your planets are rural worlds.  this is the first clue that you're doing something wrong.  in 2.2, it pays to specialize your planets.  

if one planet has a food bonus and lots of food slots, grow all your empire's food on that one planet.  specializing in food on that planet makes it an ""agri-world"" with a +5% bonus to food production, and you can build the high power +25% food bonus building there.  the only buildings other than agriculture districts and hydroponic farms you should build on your agri world.  only grow food on your agri worlds, and only employ pops to grow food as needed.  if you have a positive food balance, move any new unemployed pops on your agri world somewhere else, don't needlessly expand your food supply.  if you are running low on food and have maxed out your agri-world, time to colonize a new agri-world!

same with mineral rich planets with lots of mining district slots, make them mining worlds with the +25% mining building.  energy rich planets make them generator worlds.

now, what do you do with the planets that have plenty of room but don't have very many resource district slots?  these are your urban worlds!  build all your alloy forges on the same planet, again +5% bonus as it is becomes a forge world.  build a production ministry for an extra +15%.  have all your consumer goods made on another planet with another production ministry.   on your urban worlds, build no resource districts!  build only city districts and only as needed.  turn them into an ecumenopolis when you can.  make one of your planets all research labs, 100% research. you should have planets with only levelled up research labs and factories.

the important factor is do not overbuild.  only build one or two jobs more than your populace, having one or two pops temporarily unemployed is ok.  

if you have a planet with so many available slots that you can max out two things like energy and mining districts, it's worth it losing the 5% and down to a 2% bonus and just building both mining and energy districts with the +25% building for both.  always use levelled up buildings!  this will require lots of rare elements but you can build these in the extra slots on your energy and mineral worlds.  agri worlds you can build a few city districts and get a larger population and fill it up with hydroponic farms.  don't be afraid to build a holo temple to keep amenities high on your resource worlds.

every world in your empire should be hyper-specializing in something!  your resource planets every worker should be getting at least a 27% bonus to their work from planet specialization bonus and the production bonus building."
60,"if not, i think we should be able ti. this could be used to protect strategic assets, make sure you can't be hit from behind, etc. thoughts?"
61,"so i have the system claimed and everything, but status quo only grants me systems if i fully occupy them. does the fact that a planet in said system is still under enemy control mean i won't claim that system unless i land troops?"
62,"other than the great aspec, there doesn't seem to be many high quality consistent stellaris youtubers. do you have any favorites i should check out?"
63,"so, i was playing a very tall life-seeded xenophile egalitarian pacifist (i basically got cockblocked so hard by the number of ais i had 15 systems at most) so i went what the hell my only chance to stay competitive with glavius' ai is to go all in on pop growth and science.

so i used most of my resources to get good relations with all over galaxy and get migration treaties. my planet went to over 120 pops in less than a hundred years. my main species was 40 pops at most. then i noticed something: they were starting to decline after growth hit the limit.

i don't know what happens if you let your primary species decline but i'm not sure if a happy egalitarian paradise is going to be that so much if the species responsible for it stops having sex and fades from existence.


also humans op, they got absorbed and displaced out of sol and they are third most numerous species in the galaxy, yet they have no home."
64,"i see vassalization as one thing, and that’s the ability to extend your power while still playing tall. and you of course get the remaining of their fleet. 

but other than that, what are the benefits compared to just taking the systems outright? any tech? minerals? increased influence? increased naval capacity?"
65,"this is what i mean: [https://i.imgur.com/rzqpzgy.png](https://i.imgur.com/rzqpzgy.png) 

&amp;#x200b;

what do those numbers do? "
66,"prior to this big update, i would put all of my planets in a sector except my core world. this was super handy for me because i could just do military and research and have the sector handle all the building, colonization, and micromanagement for me. now, setting the sector to auto build doesn’t seem to do anything- it won’t build things on planets automatically. on top of that, it keeps making a bunch of sectors instead of one big one. is there any way to automate all the building like i could before? i just want to claim territories and then have the ai do all the micronanagent like i could before."
67,"so in my game right now i have done some modifications on my robot species and all my robots in my empire have the modifications now. however the new robots that are being created are always just standard versions (without modifications).


&amp;nbsp;


i am probably just missing something, but how do i fix that?"
68,"i've never found myself needing it... at all. the market just isn't diverse enough to need it. almost every game (with settings meant to be as random as possible) i've found i usually have access to an abudance of every resource by the time i unlock it without even paying attention to resources. i usually heavily specialize my empire to alloys but even then in fully self sufficient without evem considering it.

i saw a post joking about adding elements needed to form metals and i feel like that might be a good idea that would allow specialization and some degree of market reliance. have a number of common metals needed for early tech slowly evolving into requiring more and more rare resources until you get to a point where chances are you cannot sustain it without a foreign nation.

this would also allow for moments like norway v venezuela. they are both countries with their economies focused on oil but when the oil crash hit it only affectwd venezuela because they had focused their market solely on oil whereas norway had a more diversified economy. now imagine your selling black matter during a war so there is a high demand. then the war ends and suddenly demand is almost non existant and your economy crashes. beautiful."
69,"the ai will (usually) colonize planets. they'll usually build districts too. they love constructing new buildings. however the ai only ever upgrades the capital building. the other buildings, such as alloy foundries or science labs, are never upgraded.

this means by mid game the ai falls hopelessly behind. their foundries offer 2 jobs while my foundries provide 10 jobs. i have 5x the production of the ai because i have 5x as many scientists/artisans/forgers. even on grand admiral difficulty the ai still falls behind. on grand admiral difficulty the ai gets a +100% job production bonus, so this makes their 2 jobs as if it was 4 jobs. even still, i have 10 jobs per building.

its even more obvious when there's a small empire, such as an empire with only a single planet. machine empires seem to be unable to colonize, but okay, they're playing a tall game, that can work. the problem is the machine empires don't upgrade their buildings either. their tech level is equvilient to mine but they're still only using basic buildings on their homeworld. they may have 150 pops by then, but they have enormous unemployment and over-population because nothing is upgraded. their production is also a small fraction of what it could be. a tall planet is a fearsome beast. a fully upgraded forgeworld can produce nearly 1,000 alloys a month all by itself. a fully upgraded science planet can output 3,000 science.

while the beta branch ai is much improved and is no longer totally passive, its still quite bad. even on maximum difficulty the ai is only competitive early on when everyone is using basic buildings.

yes, there is glavius' ai mod, but the ai should be generally competent in vanilla, including being able to use basic functionality such as colonizing planets or upgrading buildings."
70,i would love to know how to play it well. that said share your playthroughs and tips :) 
71,"while i was busily gulping up unemployed to dump at one of my brand new ring world sites, i realized that it was much easier to grab fist fulls of clerks after i'd gotten all the unemployed moved to extend the period between my next unemployment run.  

which got me to thinking:  there should be a metric for clerks to migrate between planets pretty easily.  that would solve most of the unemployment problem by attacking the 'fatty' layer of clerks.  it makes more sense as they have jobs and are on the bottom of the career path.  

basically the clerk role (which i view more as a secondary employment role anyway) is a job with the special characteristic that they will frequently move to planets with open jobs or free clerk slots.  as the clerk exists as a kind of catch all in the first place, moving those people off planet (where they could be promoted) would free up existing clerk roles for the unemployed.  

every year, 1 in 10 clerks would have a chance to travel to a new world to set up shop.  this would let you fill up jobs on new worlds more quickly, and would do wonders for removing the unemployment problem (assuming some jobs were still available)"
72,"i ask because my friend always has just a mass of corvettes, and typically i go carrier/flak cruisers. i've never beaten him in battle though, because i've been too scarred. can some combat vets tell me when is good and what's not?"
73,"i don't know if i'm just blind, but where is the ""terraform"" button on planets?"
74,"i can't really continue playing stellaris at a certain point in the game - it's not that i am bored, i would love to play longer but my fps get very low later in the game which makes it impossible to continue.

the computer i have right now is really bad and i want to upgrade it a little bit so i could play in the late game better, most of the time i am at 10 fps at 2400 in-game time, i want it to be higher and having a better processor should help i guess since during the early phases of the game it runs with 60 fps on the highest settings all the time.

&amp;#x200b;

the processor in my computer is a intel core i5-4570 cpu @ 3,20ghz, my graphics card is a radeon r9 280x and i got 8gb ram, i also have stellaris and steam on a ssd. so, does anyone know if i only need to switch to a better processor to get better fps or do i also need a new graphics card? i am not sure if i do because as i said, the early game is running fine, only the later stages are running very bad."
75,"so before 2.2 it gave you two species which would grow individually. now the new system gives you 11 pop at the beginning, which is pretty good, but the two pops don't grow at the same time. 

so in my opinion. the double growth rate is what made it good. just wanted to share some thoughts after my last game. "
76,so i have tried out all the latest updates for stellaris but can't seem to get into 2.2. i loved 2.1 and my favorite version is still 1.9 but i cant seem to get into the latest patch. is anyone else having this problem playing the game. i hope i'm not the only one still playing 1.9 though. i feel like that is the o e that felt more like an actual space fighting grand strat game.
77,"title.
what technology or ascension perks would you need to take in order to integrate an uplifted species into a hive mind (have them join the hive mind)"
78,"been trying out a fanatic authoritarian militarist feudal society. its ok so far (going into midgame) but i think it could be improved. something that's really good now with the civic is you can split expansion areas off into vassals and it keeps your admin cap down. it may even be that as a civic it's just subpar and should really be a separate government authority.

1- vassals should operate diplomatically independently. even declaring war on neighbors and other vassals.

2- there should be automatic sharing of technology to vassals with the civic. before this was the finisher effect on the domination tree. now it seems gone entirely. for feudal society, if there's no tech sharing your vassals tend to be weak and useless which makes the civic kind of suck. to be frank i'd be fine with it being one way, your vassals get your tech.

3- there needs to be a special casus belli provided with the civic or offered as an ascension perk that lets you declare war on neighbors to turn them into feudal vassals (with the same ideology). it can even work like liberate, where if its a status quo peace then it creates a new vassal with the planets/systems. this kind of special cb synergies well with a civic that has lots of vassals.

4- development priorities for certain vassals. so like your vassals could specialize and you tell them what to do (almost like a sector). like you could tell them to expand to certain systems maybe, up to some fraction of their admin cap. or you could tell them to focus on building certain fleet types (lots of kinetic weapons for example). in my mind these priorities would be territorial and military as that is what feudalism was all about, military+territorial priorities.

5- more feudal authority  vassals should improve the starting skill level of your heir. just a thought to represent having better royal marriages

6- any vassal that become sufficiently powerful and doesn't like you should be able to start a war for the throne. taking over as head of the empire, while you become their vassal.

lastly- vassals should receive names that are appropriate, like county, duchy, etc.

&amp;#x200b;

let me known what you guys think and if you have any suggestions.

&amp;#x200b;

edit1: you know the more i think on it the more it seems like this could be part of an update to improve diplomacy overall, vassals, federations, etc.

&amp;#x200b;

edit2: maybe give feudal empires like a better version of subjugation cb? the fact that i can't demand saubjugation while some is at war or i am at war is a bit dumb. it makes the game very slow.

&amp;#x200b;

edit3: as it stands i dont even seem to be able to vassalize someone in a federation. just occupied all their systems and planets and status quo peace just ends the war taking/vassalizing nothing. pretty sure this is a bug because it says it creates a new empire and i get a popup with that new empire, but it just never gets created. old empire just stays around."
79,"so you are just starting up a new game! ready to explore the universe and conquer races!

&amp;#x200b;

==**you make up your race and pop into the game. you need to do all the default starting things like setting up default policies, species setup etc.**

&gt;the are all things you should be able to set your default policies, species settings at the race creation screen instead of every time when you start.

&amp;#x200b;

==**you continue on choosing your starting tech current opening tech:**[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mfechhgtip5gmtzvxcbvgiaaefk8pevg4epzbv3\_bla/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mfechhgtip5gmtzvxcbvgiaaefk8pevg4epzbv3_bla/edit)for some reason i am able to research interceptors (without having a ship that can use them until cruisers), hydro farms (which are pretty useless),and orbital boost tech (which i don’t have any yet)

&gt;i also noticed that there isn't a way to get food processing building or mineral purification building in the starters (unlocking it from eco simulation/geothermal fracking) so i either choose ship tech or research +tech (the boring choice).

&amp;#x200b;

==**i am finally done setting up my initial empire settings. i only have 100 minerals so i can’t do anything on my planet and i noticed that my starting planet is only a size 16.planets should be locked at a 20 size unless you have a civic such as life-seeded. having a 16 planet start means you only get 3 unlocked or 6 extra districts only and will totally hurt.==i select my constructor ship in my main star i have a 2 mineral and 3 energy orbital ready to used. the mineral tile will take 50 months (4 years) to recoup costs (plus 1 energy upkeep on to of that) and the energy will take 33\~43 months (2.75\~3.6  years) or so. i build the energy orbital.**

&gt;the income generated from expanding generally is not a lot unless you luck out with high number of mineral or energy tiles. one fix for this would be to  have all 2 orbitals (not rares) should be changed to 3 and then see if other fixes are required, prob lowering orbital upkeep)  
&gt;  
&gt;currently to expand you are paying 100 alloys (equivalent to 400 energy) and 100 minerals . on top of that each station and orbital cost 1 energy and generally ends up costing more energy than it is worth expanding.

&amp;#x200b;

==**i see a planet beside me and i want to start building a colony ship and take it over.**

&gt;newly built colonies have a -50% to pop growth, they are already a huge drain on resources and time. it takes years before they are able to produce anything. this -50% should either be just for the first 5 pops or removed.

&amp;#x200b;

==**after getting myself situated, i go to war with my neighbor. i take over one of this planets and i take territory. i immediate notice that everything is in the red because all the ai’s pops are doing clerk jobs and there is not enough energy or food on the planet.**

&gt;currently the ais does not build districts. when you take them over they have a huge deficient of food and energy and takes years to stabilize.

&amp;#x200b;

==**so after you conquered the new planet and you want to replace a building.**

&gt;the building promotes before checking if the building you are replacing has an pops for the jobs. so your replaced building creates two unemployed pops.  
&gt;  
&gt;\~if you took over a hive mind they generate a ton of unrest and crime for generations  
&gt;  
&gt;\~if you took over a robot they are slowly disassembled which generates another issues. the game organizes your buildings automatically and whenever pops drop between a certain number it ruins the building. you have no choice which building gets ruined first and generally it sorts it so civilian industries are the first building ruined which is an important building to your empire.  
&gt;  
&gt;buildings should either be allowed to manually sorted or at least sorted smartly where culture buildings, followed by research are on the bottom. your empire won’t crumble if your unity production stops...

&amp;#x200b;

==**so now you have unemployed pops. this could of happened because when you took over a planet, you specified that the new race is a resident. this means that any of main race pops will displace all rulers and specialists.**

&gt;unemployed pops should be demoted right away. it takes way too long right now and it is just a broken system currently to have pops do nothing for years. if you want to keep a part of this system, make demoted pops upset that they get demoted but if a job of their type opens up they will take it and be happy again.

&amp;#x200b;

==**okay so you have two pops, you notice that one of your races are starting to grow on unsuitable planets which increases consumer goods costs by a lot.**

&amp;#x200b;

==**since your races are not suited for the other world at all. you decide to lock in one race to grow. if you do that then you get a -20% growth speed penalizing you further**

&amp;#x200b;

==**if you are playing egalitarians / adjacent, you cannot choose which race grows and which robots to build**

&amp;#x200b;

==**at least the pops are of different types and one is good at food, the other is good at energy. then you look at your workers and notice they do not work the jobs they are better suited to and you either need to manually fiddle with the priority buttons, migrate them to other worlds or hope pops move around eventually.**

&amp;#x200b;

==**then you notice the priority button doesn’t actually do priority but disables the jobs. this needs to be changed so you can tell the ai which jobs you want to “prioritize” and fills others when those are full**

&amp;#x200b;

**==so after all that fiddling you want to move around the pops with resettlement.**

&gt;\~first if you are egalitarian / adjacent...you can’t.  
&gt;  
&gt;\~second the resettlement screen needs more information such as how many pops are on planets, number until a building is destroyed (currently sometimes it notifies you, sometimes it doesn’t), habitability to and from planet etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a5r05n/resettlement\_planner\_redesign\_mockup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a5r05n/resettlement_planner_redesign_mockup/)

&amp;#x200b;

==**i have been building robots on a planet and noticed it has been an issue keeping up with districts needed to keep them busy.**

&gt;robots only work farm and miner jobs which doesn’t make sense, they should be able to work all worker type jobs. without it, robots fill up a planet and start becoming unemployed or you need to keep building districts and eventually start running out of power because they don’t work generators but you need power to power the robots and you are making food / mines for the robots to work.  
&gt;  
&gt;\~if you are egalitarian / adjacent you can’t move robots off planet  
&gt;  
&gt;\~if you stop the building you have unemployment / empty building slot  
&gt;  
&gt;\~research for droids (specialists) is really far down the science track

&amp;#x200b;

==**i am expanding my empire and i have a lot of srs (strategic resources) in my space but i don’t have the tech to get them.**

&gt;gas should be switched to physics and crystals to sociology. this will split the difficulty between all the sciences instead of relying on engineering alone for all the techs.  
&gt;  
&gt;on top of this the ui needs to split the common srs (motes, gas, crystals) out so i can see them on my top bar...i have a lot of room up there.  
&gt;  
&gt;also since more techs have been introduced i find even playing on .75% that the tech acquisition rate is out of wack. it should be easier to get early tech, or older techs.

&amp;#x200b;

==the game needs to change the hotkeys; technology, species need to be on it. move policies and expansion planner off. if possible, remap f11 off screenshot and use 11 and 12 for faction and leaders.

&amp;#x200b;

**==**altering pops should not take research, just time. it takes a long time to get the tech and currently it also slow down my research by another 100+ months to change some negative or add a small mod.

&amp;#x200b;

**==**allow me to declare a war of vassalization or tributary no matter the size of the other empire. also the vassal casus belli expires too fast.\*\*for reference, i play on the latest beta

80,as far as i understand habitability only affects amenities and consumer goods needs. that doesnt sound bad at all.
81,"due to a series of unfortunate events (e.g. two poorly timed wars, a sudden explosion in unemployable immigrants, and a poor fiscal policy) my economy was in shambles. earth, once the bright center of the thriving galactic trade became a land of famine and poverty. the nation was once a land of equality and xenophilia, now tension between alien immigrants and humans was rising due to a long rising wave of xenophobia brought on by war and starvation. the navy, once amongst the most powerful in the galaxy was in ruins due to the wars and a downsized military budget. stability was in the single didgets and martial law was in effect across every world. i was preplexed about why my once fantastic economy had collapsed within five years, i soon realized the answer. poor people! with their unemployment and unhappiness they were throwing my stability in the toliet and production in every field suffered for it. people were in poverty because everyone else was in poverty! i knew there could only be one answer to save humanity. 

my solution was simple, i found a quaint little planet in the outer rim of the une, and spent the last of my resources for enough credits to ""resettle"" our brave colonists. just imagine how that must have been in universe, a bright federation of nations, suddenly spends trillions to deport billions of desitute and starving people onto a random world far from home. as terrible as it was, it seems to be working. 

tldr: deport the poor to a random world to improve your economy."
82,"more out of sheer annoyance than anything else, but here goes: i'm starting to feel that there are some massive problems with stellaris galaxy generation.

now, i usually play on smaller sized maps simply because i feel that larger ones just start to feel like a slog and i'd prefer ""finishing"" my games. admittedly this problem gets \*worse\* on small maps.

what is the problem i speak of? as per title, how the game generates empires.

to use my latest game as an example. after discussion here earlier today, i wanted to check how ""utopian abundance""-living standards actually work, since it seemed - using the values from the wiki - quite overpowered. i decided i might as well make a proper run out of it and thus created a megachurch-corporation with egalitarian + fanatic spiritualist, with the goal of playing tall, strictly staying below administrative cap until i'm done with tech/ascension.

the game started all right and i was looking forward to spreading my gospel around the galaxy... until i started meeting the neighbors in my galactic playground.

first up: xenophobe fanatic materialist *megacorporation*. right off the bat, my first neighbor is dead-set on aggressive takeover.

well, bad luck, let's keep looking.  militarist fanatic materialist *megacorporation*. even *more* hellbent on aggressive takeover and immediately forms defensive pact, research pact and commercial pact with the *xenophobe* neighbor of mine.

can't get worse, right? wrong. third neighbor? xenophobe fanatic pacifist *megacorporation*. and you bet they dislike me because they're *xenophobe*. at least it's not a *massive* penalty this time around and i can slowly get on their good side.

the fourth i finally found was egalitarian xenophobe and pacifist *moral democracy*. finally an empire i can interact and spread my branch offices to, right? not quite. yet anyway. between distance and xenophobe it will take some time before i can nap them to finally make my first branch office.§m

now this is obviously a matter of chance and everything can happen, but in general i've *very* rarely been happy with the empires i face. it feels that no matter what empire i start with, my neighbors end up being the worst possible the game can throw at me.

for example, the last time i tried playing fanatic authoritarian to give slave-empire a go (before megacorp) 3/5 of my first neighbors were *democratic crusaders*. the last time i tried to play a federation-focused empire i don't think there was a single neighbor that *didn't* hate me, between fanatical authoritarians and ""we do no diplomacy""-empires and the ever-abundant xenophobes.

another problem i have is that while the game does let me tag my self-created empires as eligible for being chosen for my games, i've seen them pop in my games maybe three times combined thorough *all* my games. two of those times it was the same empire.

edit: fifth empire, fanatical authoritarian xenophobe *hegemonic imperialists*.

edit 2: sixth empire, hive mind. so out of all the empires in a tiny map, *two* are the kind i can make branch office in. 3 are rival megacorps and one is a hive mind. 1/3 are opposite fanaticals to my empire, 2/3 are xenophobes."
83,"in stellaris, i've always played materialists and gone for robots. with utopia, i always went synth. as soon as synthetic dawn came, i played almost exclusively machine empires. sure, they had some serious disadvantages, but hell, *they were fun*. plus, i'm not against modding the hell out of the game to make it more fun and fix anything that isn't.

a couple of days after 2.2 was released and enough of my mods were updated to appease me enough to put down spyro and epic battle fantasy 5 long enough to turn all organics in the galaxy into electricity again, i saw a lot of posts talking about how mes were nerfed into the ground. i figured, maybe the reviews were overstated. or maybe even if they aren't it's somewhat fixable. maybe someone's already made a mod that fixes any problem people are currently having with mes.

fast forward to today, and i can assure you, the reviews were *under*stated, the problems plaguing machine empires are *not* reasonably fixable, and mods that slap bandaids on the massive leaks only serve to reveal even more problems.

first off, the problems of a machine empire.

machine empires, as you may expect, do not require food to survive and grow [citation needed]. instead, they require energy to survive, and minerals to grow. this may look like a positive, since you can just ignore food and focus on minerals/energy, which are important anyway, right?

first issue: district limits. by default, there will always be at least 3 energy districts, 1 mineral district, and 3 food districts. it's not hard to find planets that are lacking in minerals or energy, but plentiful in food. even with the bigger colonies mod, you'll often be left with these relatively useless districts.

""but you can use bio generators to convert food to energy"" except it converts food to energy rather inefficiently - 20 food to 15 energy (i believe it used to be 20-20, which was reasonable, but 2.2.2/gai [which is porting what it can from 2.2.2 to 2.2.1] nerfed it to 15). to put it in perspective, it takes 10 farmers and 3 building slots to produce the energy produced by 11.25 tech drones. if looking purely at workers, it's a *very* slight boon, but the conversion also costs building slots, which could be something more useful. you don't even see any gain in energy generation until the 3rd reactor (2 farms+1 reactor gives 15 energy and 4 excess food, vs 16 energy from 2 generator districts. 4 farms+2 reactors gives 30 energy and 8 excess food, vs 32 energy from 4 generator districts. 5 farms+3 reactors gives 45 energy, vs 40 energy from 5 generator districts). it's ultimately a loss.

""but you can also sell food on the market"" true, i've seen the prices be as good as a 1:1 ratio of selling food for energy. the second you start selling food, though, the ratio gets worse. if at any point you get a 100:66 ratio, you're better off just not farming.

furthermore, you're going to research techs that boost your energy production, like the energy nexus and the ""+10% from tech drones"" tech. that's just a fact. however, if you're -also- making food, now you also need to research food bonuses and food buildings to keep up. that's tech points better spent elsewhere. you could have researched something more useful, like terraforming tech. which leads me to my next point.

second issue: you can forget about research if you're playing a machine empire. machines are heavily reliant on expansion (more on that later) and basic resources. if you have pops without a job, you're putting them to work in the mines, reactors, and factories. with their abysmally slow pop-growth (even with all possible modifiers), you can't afford to man more than that, and energy is a huuuuuuuge need for mes. you can build no districts but energy districts and still come out losing energy.

furthermore, because pop-growth is so slow, you're forced to expand - which is energy intensive and alloy intensive. if you're going to make a colony, you have to stop everything else you're doing to send drones to the new colony to sit around picking their oil-ports until the population reaches a size where they're capable of building pops on their own so they can actually begin producing energy and minerals. until then, they're a massive drain on resources, rather than a net gain. the colony's basically useless until you get 10 pops there, at which point it's mildly self-sustaining and can start dripping back profits.

so why not try playing tall instead? because that's not a choice for mes. i've tried it, several times (mostly because i couldn't reliably get enough alloys to actually expand, and energy was so much of a problem that if i did, i'd run out of energy). if you don't colonize other planets fast, you'll soon hit a point where you can't get more energy, and your population will be so low that you can't support increasing science production. even if you do it anyway, everyone else will be ahead of you.

robots need energy for resettling, blocker clearing, typical building/starbase maintenance, generating unity, and simply existing - existing will by far be the most expensive part of the bill. they need minerals to make buildings, districts, replaceable parts, making alloys, generating science, and building pops. they need alloys to feed the neverending expansion caused by always running low on energy and minerals, both with starbase creation and colony ship creation (oh, and forget making a navy for a long while, and forget fielding a large/good one for even longer. ships are expensive to build and have an alloy maintenance cost. this impedes your expansion immensely. enjoy seeing everyone around you having a ""superior"" or ""overwhelming"" fleet. even if you did make a fleet, it's not like war will help you much due to having low influence generation). alloys especially are very hard to get - vanilla it's a 6 mineral - 2 alloy ratio (gai it's 6-3), and each foundry only creates 2 jobs, and requires 5 pops per building (and your pop generation is *s l o w*). you're going to need at least 4 of these on your home world (so 48 minerals-&gt;16-24 alloys). the advanced version requires getting lucky with tech choices (x2, the mineral-&gt;mote building and the advanced alloy building techs) because your low research generation in these two fields means you can't just burn through low-tier techs until you get what you want.

ironically, mes are *very* good at society - don't let your 200/300 research points per month fool you, 250 of that's society, and the rest is split between physics and engineering. considering society's always been considered the weakest tech branch, and doubly so for mes who need engineering for most of their tech-equivalents, it's rather funny how *society* of all research types is easy to come by. the reason why is because mes are also reliant on unity to work. for mes, it's a rush to megastructures and machine worlds. coordinators are the best source of unity. they also give a bunch of society research. they also eat up 3 energy. at least machine worlds require a society tech, so that's not that bad, but both megastructures and synthetic age require engineering.

issue 3: extreme reliance on expansion *and* unity. mes require lots of minerals and energy. if you are lucky with spawn generation and are given enough room to balloon to the point where you have well over 100 systems, then great! once your currently colonized worlds aren't providing enough e/m, you can colonize another world in your massive borders and use the resources there. and, of course, mining stations are a boon. i seem to get more basic resources from mining stations than planets. of course, this is also the only time you'll be getting a reliable amount of science via research stations. however, if at any point, *especially* early game, you find yourself boxed in and you don't have machine worlds or megastructures (especially megastructures), and you're not going to be getting them *real* soon, you may as well quit right there and start over.

to give an example, in my most recent game, i had tossed in a mod that cleared up one of the biggest issues with mes, their slow pop-production. it does this by changing the robot factory to have a cap of 4 per planet and provide 2 jobs each. now, that's for both robots and machines, so it's not purely a me buff. i definitely needed it this run, as i ended up boxed in. i had no choice but to play tall. and thanks to being able to field 8 pop-builders on each planet, that was actually possible. however, i quickly reached a point where an increase in population hurt me more than it helped. all of the planets in my own borders had their district count capped, i couldn't add more energy or mineral production. my starbases and even outposts (from the starbase mod that gives 24 m/b slots to starbases, and i modded that to add in the removed feature that gave outposts module and building slots. spoiler alert, i needed them) were kitted out with everything that could boost energy, mineral, and even science production. however, despite completing 4.5 tradition trees, i never managed to come across climate restoration, and thus couldn't get machine worlds. briefly before this point, i had come across the market exploit, and since i was just trying to have some fun without being too serious for this run, i did it (currently looking at ways of getting rid of the exploit for future runs, though so far it looks like the best way is to just not do it lol). fast forward to the death spiral (-70 minerals and -50 energy), and suddenly the exploit was needed just to survive. up until then, i had only done it once, and once the death spiral kicked in, i tried everything i could to avoid having to do it again. and then i ran out of minerals. from 15k to 0. no choice but to do it again until my resources stabilized. utilizing a cheaty exploit could not save my empire from dying once i ran out of space and didn't have access to megastructures and machine worlds.

why didn't i declare war on a neighbor? despite having a higher pop growth, alloys were still hard to come by. the ai was somehow capable of fielding 40 ships while i could only field 20, and they definitely weren't very upgraded ships (lvl 2 kinetic guns and lvl 2 shields, eventually a basic combat computer). by the time i was capable of attacking them, they were now in a defensive pact with my other neighbor. i could deal with 1 guy with equivalent fleet power, but not 2. by the time i could realistically make a fleet to deal with both, now they're in a federation with the largest empire in the game. i had no choice but to sit in my corner. and i ran out of time.

to summarize the issues, machine empires are heavily reliant on basic resources (namely energy and minerals), can't focus on research (at least on-world) due to needing alloys to get more basic resources, has a max pop production worse than organics who focus a little on food, and even when getting rid of max pop production issues, you're running against the clock on when you get boxed in and when you get megastructures/machine worlds. machine worlds alleviate the issues with resources, and megastructures allow you to generate resources without a planet. i have never considered building a dyson sphere other than because i could. 2.2 machine empires though? downright necessary.

i've played a lot of me games. i'm familiar with the strategies for pre-2.2. i've tried that and various new strategies for 2.2. i've tried modding out the disadvantages of mes without breaking the balance too much. i've tried modding out the disadvantages without care to balance. i've tried straight-up cheating. it always resulted in the same. they are always playing catch-up, and in the cases where they aren't, they've got a time limit until they break. as soon as they stop expanding, they die.

alright paradox, you win. i'll go play the space commies instead."
84,"background: i started a mp game with a friend and we ran in so many bugs it wasn't worth playing anymore

&amp;#x200b;

so is stellaris playable again? or are there still so many game breaking bugs that it isn't worth it to start a new multiplayer run? is the ai competitive again or still broken?"
85,"i think there should be a mechanic that limits the accessibility of certain pops to certain strata.

for instance, it's weird that in my authoritarian aristocratic empire, resident pops are able to raise to nobility. there is no issue with them being specialists, but being given the right to become free workers or specialists also means being given the right to raise to nobility or rulership. that makes no sense.

social mobility should be tightly controled in authoritarian states, that consciously separate workers, the middle-class and rulers. the fact that a species is not enslaved should not mean they can raise to high strata.

#an example of how this could be implemented:

**full citizenship** grants the right to have leaders and ruler strata, same as vanilla.

**residence** grants the right to become specialists.

**servitude** limits the pop to being in the worker strata, but retain their freedom, which means the are somewhat happier but have higher upkeep than slaves.

**slavery** limits the pop to being in the worker strata, with the exception of special kinds of slaves such as domestic servitude being entertainers and such. they consume less consumer goods and housing. same as vanilla.

*this has nothing to do with living standarts.* 

you can mix and match these, for instance, a empire might have a resident species with academic privilege, while other species in the same strata have rights only to basic sustenance. servitude workers might have access to decent living conditions while a full citizen species are stratified society and get less privileges when they are in the worker strata."
86,"as i'm ""re-trying"" old races of mine in 2.2 i have also redone my fanatically authoritatian / xenophobe flowers.

idea is simple: plusses to habitability and breeding, minus to experience and life-length. 

a storm sweeping over the universe in its spring, but fragile and quickly wrinkling in the autumn. 

&amp;#x200b;

back in the day they had a caste-system which i loved. 

going through the perks i thought ""slaver guilds"" sounds exactly like my jam, completely oblivious to what i actually signed on. 

&amp;#x200b;

to recap: it makes your slaves more awesome! but it also makes it so that 40% of your race is always slaves. no going under that limit. 

&amp;#x200b;

this ... is both awesome and terrible. 

&amp;#x200b;

awesome because i'm impatient in nature and that has killed my last 2 plays. i simply built too many buildings too early in the game to make most of my species into specialists, nobody working the mines and farms anymore and my whole empire dying a slow and painful death. 

but slaves always remain workers. so after i colonized a shitload of planets and built a ridicoulus amount of districts/buildings, to the point where i started asking myself whether going over the administrative cap by a factor of 12 (\~600 / 50) was actually a good thing because now leaders suddenly cost 1100 energy, i was doing awesome!

&amp;#x200b;

at least i thought so. the downfall began slowly as one planet after another had a declining stability and a rising in crime. 

crimewaves, gangwars, drug deaths suddenly everywhere. anarchy, slave uprisings and violence spread like a wildfire through my empire and stupid me just build a noble district and precincts everywhere. 

""that'll show them!"", i thought not realizing my error. 

it tooks decades of more violence until i realized that i had built a police building, but had no police force. nobody was working the precincts as i had no specialists. 

&amp;#x200b;

and worse ! because now i realized why i created so few alloys! yes my mines were all working, but barely any of the alloy factories had people in it. 

i had planets with close to 20 scientist jobs open and still people jobless and joined a crimering because they were slaves.

&amp;#x200b;

there suddenly was a unique problem which i never had before: my empire got crushed under the burden of slavery !

&amp;#x200b;

let me repeat that, because this is the stellaris sub and i too thought this to be a mathematical impossibility before yesterday:

**my empire had too many slaves!**

&amp;#x200b;

i then made a final mistake after realizing my problem. (after frantically searching for an ""unslave"" button for pops for around an hour, finally seeing that slaver guilds is the reason for my conundrum)

you can probably see it already, the stupid stupid error of mine that would follow:

&amp;#x200b;

i reformed my government and exchanged slaver guilds with something else. 

&amp;#x200b;

a massive shift flew through my empire. billions of pops were suddenly free. free from the mines and the endless farmwork. free to move into the cities and pursue their own hopes and dreams. only the filthy xenos remaining in the dirty work. 

crime was eliminated almost instantly across the stars. 

a new wave of technologies were gained within the first few years. 

trade, consumer goods and amenities flooded on all planets. 

the crops died as noone tended them. 

the mineral mines laid still. 

hunger arrived fast, although a crisis could be averted for now thanks to the glactic market. 

then the alloy factories stopped getting resupplied. 

next the factories for consumer goods. 

&amp;#x200b;

hoping to stop the worst, i stopped all factories. massive layoffs everywhere. what should have been a new era became the worst unemployment crisis my empire had ever seen. and with unemployment ... crime started again ... bringing me full circle to the original problem i sought to fix a few decades earlier. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm slowly working myself out of this slump. restarting the factories one every few years. fighting crime everywhere. buying more slaves for the mines from the market. 

&amp;#x200b;

in a way ... my flowers just lived through their first winter. laying dormant in the emptiness of space. waiting. waiting for a new spring. 

&amp;#x200b;

(fuck and/or yeah) slaver guilds!

87,"after checking the reddit posts religiously and rounding out a game as a mi, i thought a summary post was in order.

###district limits

whilst robots can populate any planet, not needing to utilise food districts means that the only use you get out of food rich planets are from either favourable trade circumstances (never guaranteed) or going building heavy on your planets to turn food into credits.

this awkwardly throttles any attempts at tall play. with food jobs available through buildings, and no equivalent for mis, tall play requires lucky mineral/generator rich planets to support it.

###food/society research

similar issues to above, your research queue will be taken up at times with techs you will likely never want. your unity producing buildings will give you a great deal of society research that you don't necessarily want or need.

###resource throttling

as a mi, you will run into issues with energy. the upkeep on your pops, and the need to produce unity will catch you off guard at some point. this is more of an annoyance, as it can be difficult to properly forecast how many tech drone jobs you need.

the harder thing for mis is minerals. the vast majority of your income for minerals in 7.20 is through jobs. jobs are dependent on your planet districts. you have no other ways of reliably (trade is feasible at times) producing the following except with minerals:  research, alloys, strategic resources, pop growth.

###pop growth

pop growth in mis require a job to progress. replicators will take your much needed minerals and slowly turn them into a new pop. pop growth is therefore rather expensive, as you have both the upkeep for the pop in the job and the cost of that job being undertaken. it also requires more substantial investment, as that pop has cost you resources, requires housing and a workplace.

###trade value woes

you do not get to capitalise on trade value whatsoever. you like having energy credits for your upkeep, leaders, tile blockers, resettling and so on, but this avenue is blocked to you.

###consumer goods woes

you do not get to utilise consumer goods. everything comes from minerals. this is not a problem, except that minerals become very very dear to mis as a result.

##late game considerations

ringworlds do not have mineral extraction. they are useful to you only for their energy production capabilities and tremendous size.

machine worlds will finally enable you to produce the minerals you need. all of your district limit may, at that point, be utilised for mining. this quickly becomes all too necessary.

the matter decompressor can fill out your mineral needs late in the game.

habitats don't really seem to suit mis, though perhaps if you transition to machine worlds early enough you can actually run the research jobs available without a problem.

##what's still good about mis?

being able to settle every planet is tremendous. each planet you settle is more pop growth, and everything in stellaris these days are pops and their jobs.

further, pop growth is actually pretty good. my capital is currently pumping out a pop every year or so with all the available pop growth bonuses. it's resource heavy and expensive, but at year 2350 i have 1300 pops to the highest a.i. at 550, playing peacefully on only 43 systems.

there is the potential for good specialisation. if you decide ahead of time to run a world for research/strategic resources, you can customise your pops growing on that planet accordingly. this can of course create some issues in transferring pops between planets.

as ever, not worrying about factions, divergence, unrest, happiness is bliss. the game can get a little micro heavy at times...

##possible fixes?

i don't actually think too much needs to be done to tweak mis. none of the faults here are too horrific that they are unplayable, it's just the bottleneck that will always occur coupled with the sluggish early game. still, what do you guys think of these 'solutions', do you have any of your own?

* mining/generator districts have 3 jobs instead of 2

* reduce minerals needed for replicator jobs.

* have farming districts count as potential mining/generator districts.

* allow the transition to machine worlds earlier/cheaper.

* have coordinators give unity and engineering (instead of society).

* allow restrictions on which model robots can do which jobs.

* make food technologies less likely to appear in the tech queue.

* allow a mineral/energy building to replace the farming building.

bear in mind if all of these were implemented i think mis would be incredibly overpowered."
88,"there are a lot of ways to increase energy production (because it is simultaneously energy and money).

there are hydroponics farm for food.

but there are only  purification plants (and hubs) for mineral production, despite the fact that minerals are the key source for making basically everything else. you cant even build any sort of a mining building on artificial habitats. i fell like you basically have to construct a matter decompressor and make huge minerals buying contracts to support your fleets lategame."
89,"something i would love to see in a future update, is the ability to set a fleet/army status to ""contractor"" or something along those lines, which would allow other empires, who are at war, to hire your secondary fleets/armies, for a monthly cost (based on the size and quality of the ships and troops) . that way, people who are playing as more passive play styles, can still defend themselves if they suddenly end up in a war, and people who play as more ""war-like"" empires can maintain income by hiring out their fleets/armies when they're not currently in a war, or surrounded by friends or something. just an idea that i had..

&amp;#x200b;

it is my understanding that *ship\_hull\_regen\_add\_perc* &amp; *ship\_armor\_regen\_add\_perc* regenerates the hull/armor with a set daily percentage. i tested these modifiers with values of 3, 30 and 3000. and no in-combat regeneration was observed :( theses specific modifiers are, among others, used by engineer admiral trait and devouring swarm government trait.

&amp;#x200b;

moved on to test with modifiers *ship\_hull\_regen\_add\_static* &amp; *ship\_armor\_regen\_add\_static*. i believe this modifier is supposed to add a set amount of daily regeneration. again no in-combat regeneration was observed :( these modifiers are used by nanite repair and regenerative hull tissue.

&amp;#x200b;

i am certain that in-combat regeneration was a thing in earlier versions of stellaris - maybe versions pre-2.0(?)

so did they remove combat regeneration from the game? or can someone post the correct modifier for regeneration during combat? :o)

97,"so, on the whole i find that i rather like the trade route system. it makes me feel like i'm managing a sprawling, interstellar empire in a way that v2.1 and earlier never did. i also like that gives you a reason to build up some military strength even if you're an isolationist empire surrounded by friends.

but there are some things that bug me, and i'm curious if maybe a solution already exists and i'm just too stupid to see it.

1. **can i override the default trade route paths?** it makes a lot of sense that the automatic pathfinding seeks to minimize distance. however, it's deeply frustrating when i've got patrol fleets keeping my empire completely safe, but then i finish a gateway in my home system and all of my trade routes are rerouted to a path that goes through my piracy-ridden neighbor and my economy tanks. is there a way for me to say ""i don't care which path is shorter, take **this** path because it's safer""?
2. **can i fine-tune patrol paths?** when there are two paths from a colony to my capital and both are of equal length, i've had it happen where my trade routes chose one of the paths but my patrol took the other, leaving a few systems unprotected. is there any way i can deal with that?
3. **why don't trade routes automatically connect to the capital?** sometimes when i set up a new starbase, and most times that i conquer one, i get a notification that it's disconnected from the trade network and needs to be manually linked. why does that happen? and is there a downside to connecting it to a starbase other than my capital? intuitively, it feels better to connect the new starbase to the end of an existing and well-protected trade route, so i minimize the number of paths that need patrolling. but maybe there's some downside that isn't immediately clear."

100,"so i have been pondering machine empires, their growth is slow and they have trouble suporting themselves and growing. most importantly farming districts are kind of useless. so here are some of my thoughts on how to rebalance them and keep them mechanically unique.

so the problem.of districts and slow growth, farms have to be useful. the easy way to solve this is to make robot pops more productive, hives get +1 job and fast growth, so give machines 5 base energy/mineral, or for farms 2 energy, 2 minerals and 2 food per farm tile. fluff it as biodiesel and bioplastics or whatever.

also the slow growth means less buildings, so they need better bang for their buck on some critical buildings, so have them generally give +1 production on most jobs, with corresponding gly greater input.

the farm change would leave rouge servitors in a lurch, so make the biotrophy status give -50% food consumption, they are pampered and so don't burn as many calories. also since rouge servitors need to deal with food and consumer goods for dubious benefits give them accsess to trade to give them something unique.

these changes should make it possible for machine empires to compete even with less pops and shower growth. what do others think? is this a good solution to the problem or does it make machine empires too strong?

also i'm trying with the idea of a special instant edict that costs 100 influence modified by empire size to spawn a new robot pop on your capital. it'd make playing tall easier but i'm not sure how balanced it would be."
101,"who else thinks that there should be a happiness modifier for having a fleet in the system or in orbit of a colony?
based on the citizens feeling safer having a fleet presence in the system. "
102,"slavery in stellaris is pretty similar to citizenship except that slaves are less productive, unhappier and less costly. as such besides min-maxy economic benefits a economy run with enslaved pops doesn't feel that different than one run with citizens. they both do the same things roughly as well and there's no reason to do one over the other besides roleplay.


i propose that a new class of dangerous jobs be created to give slavery and roboslavery a niche that citizens are unsuited to fill. a dangerous job is one like coal mining, gladiator work, or plantation farming where the environment or the conditions kill its workers necessitating the import or creation of more labor.


how this would work in game.

* a worker working a dangerous job has a very small chance of dying every month. therefore a planet with a decent amount of worked dangerous jobs will have a fairly consistent deathrate per year.
* some strategic resources are changed from being only obtained from mining stations to dangerous planetary jobs or normal refining. refining for strategic goods is completely safe.
* buildings which add dangerous jobs should create 6+ jobs which prioritize the lowest social group(workers, slaves or robots) or a preferred species. slavery should be relatively labor intensive.
* planetary auto resettlement settings for when slaves die.


the effects of these changes would be that slaving and robot centric empires would have a significant comparative advantage producing certain strategic goods leading to increased specialization among empires. 


candidate resources and new buildings for dangerous jobs

* gas- obtained by refining, dangerous work or trading with the space saudis.
* motes- same as gas. increase mote costs across the board since they don't have any important resource sinks.
* zro- obtained through mining stations or harvesting large amounts of lives. slave harvesting banned for egalitarians and pacifists.
* arena- creates amenities and unity.
* generic agricultural district- only kills slave pops at a low rate. robots and citizens not affected.
* generic mining districts- has a very low chance of killing a pop. robots and citizens included.


edit: added clarification to social group about who can work unsafe jobs, added clarification about refinery safety."
103,"just a quick question. i noticed that as an avian species, my robots and droids all look like the original robot portrait and are called ""robots"". is this a design feature or a bug?

112,"after reading the discussion regarding [megastructures and ascension perks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a72lpy/megastructures_how_an_old_problem_still_rings_true/) i realised that the current tradition system is also in need of an overhaul. whilst i really like what the tradition trees have added, they are also relatively simplistic across all empires, even gestalts. eventually, you'll have completed all the trees, same as all the other empires in the galaxy.

what i believe to be a better alternative, is something akin to eu4's ideas, with players and ai empires choosing 8 traditions/ideas out of a total of 19 (currently) for example. some of these would be specifically tailored to a certain government type (democratic, oligarchic, dictatorial, imperial, hive, machine and megacorp).

using euiv as my basis i've come up with the following;

**civil society**

* discovery (research, anomalies, science)

* expansion (colonisation, growth)

* prosperity (internal economy, resource output)

* harmony (pop happiness, multi-pop empires are more happy/productive) 

or

* supremacy (reduce pop political power, ruler pop happiness) 


**military**

* naval (fleet capacity &amp; power)

* defensive (starbase capacity, defense stations)

* offensive (army power &amp; cost reduction)

* quality (fleet power, army power, military leader skill)

or

* quantity (fleet capacity, army capacity??, military leader cost reduction)

**diplomacy**

* diplomacy (influence reduction on agreements, integrating federations)

* espionage (not sure yet)

* trade (external market, trade protection, commercial pacts)

* domination (vassals; income, integration) 

**special tradition trees**

* democratic (parliament, leader cost reduction)

* oligarchic (council, leader skill)

* dictatorial (advisers, leader loyalty)

* imperial (advisers, leader loyalty)

* hive mind (admin cap, growth)

* machine (admin cap, pop upkeep cost reduction)

* megacorp (trade power, resource extraction)

as you can see, my ideas aren't perfect and i can't think of all possible bonuses for each tradition group, but the basics are there. until we know what to expect from the diplo/espionage update these will do. 

ideally, this overhaul would be post-diplo/espionage update and will be released alongside an update that improves other internal political features, and ascension perks. 

for example; being able to switch government type, despite the ethics of your pops, for a significant influence spend. (e.g. democratic to imperial for 1000 influence). such a move would also cause significant unrest and instability across your space, leading to rebellion. but it would allow players to enjoy full scale civil wars if they wish. anyway, that's another topic. 

i'd like to know what you think. i know ""copying"" eu4 isn't what everyone may want, but i really do think the idea system will allow players to truly customise their empires how they want their empire to function."
113,"in the civilization series (at least the older ones) population would only grow if you had excess food.  stellaris should adopt the same model, but with housing instead of food.  a planet should only grow so long as it has enough housing for the next population.  if not, the bar grows to the end, but the pop doesn't spawn until there is sufficient housing.  this would cut down on some of the late game micromanagement needed to deal with excess populations.  

as an alternative, you could implement the above for a particular economic policy, such as utopian abundance.  after all, being homeless doesn't sound too utopian.  it's also true that in advanced countries irl, population growth tends to be flat or even negative sans immigration.  i don't see why future society wants to breed into some kind of malthusian nightmare.  "
114,"as an avid vicky player, i can't say enough how much i love the update. once the kinks get worked out, i think it will be clear that 2.2 made stellaris into the game it's always wanted to be. 

however, i have issue with the pop growth mechanics.

i don't understand why there can only be one pop growing at a time. shouldn't each species grow independently, just kind of from a logic stand point? in a more gamey sense, why is pop growth universal? in my opinion, it should clearly be a species modifier and then a planetary modifier should stack on top of this. right now, every empire still grows pops at a fairly similar rate because of these strange design choices. seems to me that you should be able to have a fast growing, heavily populated empire if you have the right species traits, habitable planets, food abundance, etc. multiethnic empires would also be more interesting if each race had distinct growth rates, and this would create a much more interesting political situation as well if ethics and species are tied together in an empire. 

the same is true in reverse as well. why can only one pop die at a time? if there is a food shortage, siege, poor habitation conditions, etc there should be simultaneous pop die off. 

i think that if the pop growth mechanics were tweaked in these ways, the economy would finally be complete. "
115,"i find the alternative jobs aristocratic elite gives pretty interesting, but the fact that it kind of nerfs your early unity production pushes me away. should i be prioritizing things like autochthan monuments or is unity not as important as i think? i feel like good unity productions gives you a big advantage early game, and i'm not sure how exactly to use the noble jobs to counteract this disadvantage. what are your thoughts for the early game strategies with aristocratic elites?"
116,"looking for a recomendation on mods or collections that relate to real space in 2.2. i'm looking for a series of mods that add new planet types, improve the graphics whithout tanking my cpu, change some gameplay mechanics and adds flavor without completly changing the game. if you have any other suggestions on new mods i could add please share.

for a rough estimate on my computer's specs i was able to run a singleplayer 2.1 game with a large galaxy with gigastructures and a ton of other mods, and it only suffered in the late game. i also recently ran a unmodded 2.2 game with all dlc(save for megacorp), and i encountered stuttering in the mid to late game, even on normal speed (note: this was inmediately after release and apparently some of the issues have been fixed)"

119,"welp, my friends made me buy this game to play with them, and i don't play a lot of strategy games. at this point i'm just so new to this, that i have no clue what's going on, i have the full tutorial on but there's so many words and my brain can't handle it lol. we played like two games through and they've started to understand more than me, i'm here still trying to figure what to prioritize. so any tips and tricks on how to expand faster, what's a good empire or an op custom empire(have all dlc), things to prioritize, good starting planet, research to prioritize, what essential ship parts should i go for? should i start out with 3 science ship? things to avoid, how to make good relationships, practically everything that should be common sense in this game. essentially i want to be overpowered and broken lol. please provide a detailed tips and tricks guide. thank you"
120,"i have not yet engaged in a commercial pact because the cost seems too high and the return too low.  i just checked and for 0.25 influence i receive 4.10 energy.  that's just not enough return.  in fact 4.10 energy is such a paltry sum, the deal would have to be free of cost for it to be worthwhile.

what are your thoughts ladies and gents?"
121,"basically, i'm on the fence on whether to buy it or not, because i'm not interested in playing as a mega corporation empire but i know that past dlcs also added something interesting besides the main gimmick (be it new mechanics or whatever else), so i would like to know if this will offer me anything outside of that type of empire. in short: if i don't play as a megacorp would having this expansion change anything for me?

also, is facing ai megacorps any more interesting than facing any other kind of ai empire? because while i don't want to play as a megacorp, i could enjoy playing against them if they provided a different challenge."
122,"i have seen a lot of threads lately pointing out how migrating minority pops often grow out the founding species and so on.  i’ve noticed that myself in some instances even thought it’s not a big issue.

the reason this happens, is presumably because the ‘growth ai’ on multicultural worlds attempts to reach equilibrium and prioritize the minorities. 

my thought is, since every pop contributes to growth wouldn’t it be more realistic if middle and ruler class pops contributed significantly less to the pop growth then the working class? 

so if you have a world with 10 human scientists and 10 blorg farmers it would make more sense if the growth ai more often picked a blorg pop for growth rather than a human (in this scenario the species traits and rights are naturally irrelevant).

if this is already the case and i have simply failed to note it, please enlighten me!
"
123,"i feel since the theme of the agrarian idyll civic is about more housing on districts with a greater focus on farms, traditions that give housing to city districts should instead give the housing to farms. maybe even replacing 1 merchant per 50 pops to a farmer as well or something too."
124,"pre-megacorp i loved stellaris. i understood how to play. sure i wasn't an exceptional player but i was able to take on the ai in ironman and win, most of the time.

however the game has changed so much and even though i've kept up with the devblogs and watched videos by a lot of players (aspec, enterelysium etc..) i really don't know how to play now. 

games start off decently, i'm generating the basics (minerals etc..)  but very quickly my empire grows (as i've always done) and i get negative values. i saw a couple of guides by larnok1 and i read them but i don't understand how districts work, how i'm supposed to generate minerals etc.. are mined and how i'm supposed to play. 

can anyone recommend some videos or guides that explain how to explain how to play stellaris now?"
125,"not understanding the mechanic.  i claimed the systems, dominated the enemy, and there were 4 main “hubs” that i didn’t receive.  this is slightly annoying because 2 of them were the only reason i went to war.  my only guess is that the systems possessed star-holds and i don’t have that tech yet."

127,"okay, so i'm fairly new to stellaris, and i started a playthrough recently as a megacorp, so far i've expanded to two planets, looking at a third and i'm maybe a halfway through the game on ironman mode.  


i haven't opened a single branch office.

why? because nobody wants to start a commercial pact! no federation, nothing, i've met six alien civs so far and all of there are hegemonic imperialists, spiritualists, or hiveminds which seem to have no interest in trade (or not since the only three civs with positive relations with me joined a federation on their own). the modifier even for a non-aggression pact always seems massive, and for something that's usually simple in other strategy games it just seems like being a megacorp is just handicapping myself in this game.  


am i missing something? any tips or tricks for playing opposite imperialist, or authoritarian civs?"

130,"such as selling 50% of mineral surplus. and when in deficit, sell nothing regardless of the players' setting."
131,"a lot of things in this update are useless. even some of the core game mechanics. playing a criminal empire or a subversive cult sounds like fun, right? to bad, the npc empires just lock you out, and if you get a criminal empire in your game, and you’re not a megacorp, you’re at 100% crime instantly and you can’t do shit about it.

habitability is basically flavor at this point.

war mechanics are...well...you can’t opt out of status quo, so it’s basically forced on you, enjoy that grindy shit.

good luck finding gas/motes/zro/ect. don’t get me wrong, it’s out there, way...way...out there. 350 systems on a medium map and i can finally support my upgraded buildings! see my next point...

administrative penalties don’t deter npc empires from gobbling the galaxy. yup, 1000% increase to everything? that’s fine...it’s fine...i go 10% over and i’m crippled. 

oh, and slavery seem to be broken right now, as none, zero, zilch, nada, of my planets are generating specialist workers, just slaves. and before you ask...yes...i checked that. and that too, yup, and that.

ai is still...having dumb ai issues. (this is more of a grand strategy issue as a whole, not unique to stellaris, but it feels a lot more prevalent with stellaris mechanics)

habitats are also useless, found this out while playing a life seeded play through...so...my empire was dead before i even started and i had no idea.

and...we still have no machine cities or craft...which would be cool as fuck.

but the new megastructures look cool, so i guess there’s that."
132,"hey, just a quick sort of dumb question - what is really the benefit of having more powerful defense armies as a pacifist, for instance? by the time people are dropping invaders on your planet, aren't your starbases captured and you're pretty much delaying your completely inevitable death?

or am i looking at this wrong?"
133,"however you feel about the balance, it's tough to deny that psionic ascension just has more *content*. it really feels like something special your species is embracing that has its own ongoing story and challenges, rather than a ""take the perk and it's done"" that the others are.

here's some ideas for revamping the other two.

**bio: gene hunting.**

* give only a few bonus traits immediately
* unlock new, powerful traits over time
* defeating living leviathans gives traits
* acquiring special pops - primitives, pre-sapients, fe, mauraders, enclave - gives more traits
* new options for existing event/anomaly outcomes give bio ships/armies/leaders
* occasional events give similar opportunities
* add kronenburg portrait pack
* option to become devouring swarm if specific combos are found

**synth: citizen software**

* second perk no longer makes you into machines
* instead gives improved cyborg trait and ""networked consciousness"" (think cyberpunk)
* new species right sets network relation. slaves get ""compulsion chips"", ruler caste get neural uplink that improves performance but amplifies political power.
* additional options come with tech
* troubles/opportunities arise from network as periodic events. examples:
* unhappy faction with high access causes sabotage, or reprograms another faction to align with them
* dead leader personality profiles found, giving option to resurrect in new body
* ""virtual job market"" created, giving one-off decision that creates jobs in a planet without needing a building
* luddite anachronistic movement wants to uninstall their upgrades. can give un-upgraded pops but happiness/unity modifier if you respect their choice, mindless drones if you use the implants to lobotomize them, or mass suicide
* eventual option to mind-control all networked pops, becoming driven assimilators

134,"my war attrition is rapidly going up despite the fact that i'm completely destroying them (they were inferior in power), i've not gained any attrition for taking over their planets. 

and i've lost attrition because i had to pull back my fleets due to the great khan emerging on the other side of my empire and when they bombarded their own planet to extermination, with their own pops i somehow got attrition for it?!

140,"buildings that convert minerals into the 3 uncommon resources (crystals/gas/motes) are almost identical to the buildings that harvest those special resources.  so that mote trap isn't really producing 2 motes, instead its producing 10 minerals.  because in the long run you want sources of all 3 resources anyway, so the resource deposits just let you do something you were already going to do, but with less minerals.

if you ask me, if you have the planet and the tech, you should get the harvestor jobs no buildings required.  this would open up the special features panel on planets to allow for a wider variety of features.  for example, something like ""electrical storms: +2 physicist jobs"" (which would be scientists that don't use consumer resources but only produce physics).  don't want to exploit the planetary feature, just disable those jobs.  would make planets more unique and exploration feel more rewarding."

148,"in 1.0, pops required 1 unit of food per month.

in 1.5, pops required 1 unit of food, and 0.5-2 units of minerals per month, through the consumer goods mechanic. food also became an empire-wide, rather than planetary, resource.

""aha,"" i thought, ""food is on the way out. it's pretty ridiculous that a quarter of the population of a starfaring empire is dedicated to farming, after all, and since both minerals and food are now global resources, food is mechanically redundant.""

in 2.2, pops require 0.75-1.5 units of food, 0-1 units of consumer goods, 1 unit of amenities and 1 unit of housing per month.

i can't see how this is anything other than feature bloat. amenities and housing are what food once was, but there are two of them, both are used exclusively for pop upkeep, both (afaik) carry similar penalties if demand exceeds supply, and any district or building that provides housing also provides amenities (though the reverse isn't true). besides some pointless busywork and the holo-theatre, i simply don't see what would be lost by merging these two resources into a single ""infrastructure"" resource that acts as a per-planet population soft-cap.

consumer goods do have a niche now, as a resource that is consumed by specialist jobs as well as by pops in general, and food also has a niche of sorts since it can be spent to increase pop growth speed, but i'm not convinced they're sufficiently differentiated yet.

haven't really touched upon machine pops here, but those sound like a hot mess right now anyway.

tl;dr, pops cost four different resources in upkeep now, and at least one of these (housing) is, imo, completely unecessary and adds nothing to the game besides needless busywork. rant over."

this can be abused even further by manipulating the price before you sell. before selling a huge amount, you can buy up an extra 10-20k of the resource the day before the sale goes through and the price you sell for will be greatly increased.

159,"taking consecrated world civic has been radically altered since 2.1 (even altered further since 2.2 with balance and bug fixes).

&amp;#x200b;

to have access to the accession perk you need to have either the spiritualist or fanatic spiritualist ethic.

&amp;#x200b;

this will give you access to 2 planetary decisions, consecrated world and revoke consecrated world.

&amp;#x200b;

these decisions can only be performed on celestial bodies in your territory that are not habitats, ringworlds, or star class bodies (this includes blackholes, neurton stars, etc. anything that is the center of a system). basically this means it can be applied to all planets, inhabitable or uninhabitable.

&amp;#x200b;

both decisions (both to add and remove the modifier) cost 50 influence base. you may only have 3 consecrated worlds at a time.

there are four tiers of consecration a planet can have, influenced by rng and planet type:

\- hive worlds, machine worlds, ai worlds, and city worlds cannot achieve a higher tier than 1.

\- asteroids, tomb worlds, gas giants, and shielded worlds have an 80% chance of being tier 1 and a 20% chance of being tier 2.

\- all other uninhabitable planets not of the classes above have a 10% chance of being tier 1, 70% chance of being tier 2, and 20% chance of being tier 3.

\- all other habitable worlds expect the ones listed above and gaia worlds have a 50% chance of being tier 2, a 40% chance of being tier 3, and a 10% chance of being tier 4.

\- gaia worlds will always be tier 4.

edit: broken worlds (planet cracker), hatched worlds (distant stars), and a few other obscure planet classes do not fit into the categories above and can break the consecration system. avoid trying to consecrate them, even if consecrating the burning husk of your rival's homeworld is poetic.



&amp;#x200b;

you may reroll a planet's tier repeatedly and endlessly as long as you are willing to spend the influence.

&amp;#x200b;

each consecrated quality tier adds 1 point per a tier level to your empire's consecrated modifier, which scales from 1 (a single tier 1 planet) to 12 (three tier 4 planets).

&amp;#x200b;

 the effects are as follows:

\- tier 1: 2% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 1% bonus amenities.

\- tier 2: 4% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 2% bonus amenities.

\- tier 3: 6% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 3% bonus amenities. 

\- tier 4: 8% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 4% bonus amenities.

\- tier 5: 10% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 5% bonus amenities.

\- tier 6: 12% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 6% bonus amenities.

\- tier 7: 14% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 7% bonus amenities.

\- tier 8: 16% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 8% bonus amenities.

\- tier 9: 18% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 9% bonus amenities. (max for uninhabited planets)

\- tier 10: 20% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 10% bonus amenities.

\- tier 11: 22% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 12% bonus amenities.

\- tier 12: 25% bonus unity and spiritualist attraction, 15% bonus amenities.

&amp;#x200b;

sources: i pulled these numbers directly from the game files for 2.2.2.

&amp;#x200b;

so your choice is basically if you want to use only uninhabitable planets you can get a max amenity bonus of 9% (pretty solid still as the nerf from 2.2.1 only effects the unity and spiritualist attraction), or if you are willing to sacrifice some influence and some trash tier (non-tomb world) habitable planets you can push that bonus up to a very respectable 15% amenities (same bonus as the mega art installation, a rather large buff from the 2.2.1 limit of 12%).

&amp;#x200b;

overall the perks is incredibly solid, providing both a massive unity boost early game (letting you snowball traditions and ignore building unity buildings), and a very rare empire wide % amenities buff. if you max this out and combine it with the mega art installation, you will reduce your amenity building and job needs by 30% per a planet, allowing for different and more useful buildings or allowing you to stack amenities to increase happiness and increase stability (for the % production bonus).

edit: you cannot consecrate a colonized world, but you can colonize a consecrated world. this does not always remove the consecrated status and does not seem to be intended."
160,"ever since i saw the ascensions perks for pop abductions and interspecies crossbreeding, i've had this idea to go full eugenics and try to breed the ultimate pops.

i'm not sure if this would ever bring any proper benefit vs just genemodding whatever you want from your founding species but roleplay wise i think it's got more flavor than even the most delicious livestock xenos.

so the plan is as follows. aquire one or a few pops of as many different species as you can. by migration treaty if you can, by raiding if you have to. have perks for cheap resettlement and deny free migration. settle pops of the chosen species in a comfy location to get busy with the enriching of the bloodlines.

should the eventual product prove to be satisfactory, move it on to continue the work. if not, throw it into a penal colony to farm food for the pops who are contributing to your glorious future. 

i'm assuming, that since every crossbreed is technically a new species, you can micromanage their rights pretty well.

so what are your thoughts about adding going full dr. mengele in to the stellaris war crime / atrocity repertoire?"
161,"tldr: i put my created races in my games, my own devouring swarm spawned next to me, killed myself??

so i really like making races in stellaris, both stat wise and for rp purposes. so naturally i lock in my own creations to appear in my games. it's fun to see my creations spawn next to me even if they dont all get along with each other so well but that's politics ya know?

then i realized yesterday as i'm exploring my new galaxy that i had  purchased utopia and just made a devouring swarm....so i spent 20 minutes frantically searching for this pocket of death i had created like someone who just lost track of a spider. it had to be somewhere right? i locked it in right? maybe it's fine maybe i didn't lock it? i found it. next to me. should be a fun game.

164,"i am wondering if somebody checked or analyzed what types of empires are generated across galaxy?

i've obviously started my first game as megacorp. first game, everything was cool. untill i've started facing other empires. first two neighbours were megacorps as well. 3rd other was traditional empire. i've stopped game because 2.2.2 was released. then i've started another game, and another. every time my neighbours are megacorps.

in two games i've been playing long enough to actually meet each empire in galaxy. both times it was way too many corps. in my current game i'm playing with 10 empires galaxy (without counting fe). i have 5 megacorps, 2 machine empires, and 3 traditional empires. and from my current experience this is typical balance.

it is only my perception bias, or this is standard? i'd be fine with guaranteed second megacorp in galaxy. or additional empire similar to city state in civ- i.e. not expanding tiny empire which develops only via establishing branches. but not 5 megacorps in 10 empire galaxy."

166,"sorry if this comes across as entitled or rude, i just really wanted the warfare system to be better and was disappointed, and i wanted to vent out what i was feeling. 

---

the whole warfare system is cool in concept, especially since patch 2.0, but after having gotten back into the game with 2.2 and played several runs i have to admit it doesn't even really feel engaging at all. 

economics, absolutely. i've learned a lot about how to incrementally develop planets here, focus production on the right planets there, how to best protect trade, yada yada yada. economics is the reason i'm playing the game right now. but military? i feel like i am as unaware with military tactics as when i started. 

**tactics**

where is the strategy to warfare? there's about four tactics i've discovered so far, and every war i fight i just use some combination of them. 

a) have a larger navy

b) have better generals

c) have better tech

d) lure them into attacking your chokepoint starbases

none of these make wars or battles very intense or engaging. either i overwhelm them, or they overwhelm me (usually only when they're marauders or fallen empires). 

**ship design and fleet composition**

how do i know the best way to design ships? all i know is that weapons with high tracking are good against ships with high evasion (corvettes and destroyers), and missiles are good against larger ships. i'll admit, this is a little bit of strategy that i appreciate is there.

however, i know there's supposed to be a whole rock-paper-scissors mechanic with weapons good against armour vs weapons good against shield vs weapons that surpass both etc. but i find that that rarely actually shows up in gameplay, if at all. why?

1. there's no espionage so it's hard to spy on enemy ships to know what counters you should use them. 
2. wait until a war to see the ships they have? by that point it's too late to build a fleet or retrofit your fleet to a new design, since building/upgrading fleets takes so long and costs so much. 
3. most enemy ships i've seen use a balance of all types of weapons and armour, so there's no point in countering. in the end i just end up designing my ships with a balance of weapons and armour and it feels boring. 

i used to play galactic civilizations back in the day. when i'd go to war with other empires, i'd spy on their empire or send a few scout ships to see what weapon and armour types they used. this felt cool because i felt like i was a nation doing reconnaissance to prepare for a war. then once i knew what their ship design was, i'd design a new type of ship to perfectly counter them. for example, if i'd see most of their ships were equipped with missile-weapons and missile-armour. then i'd design a new ship loaded with laser weapons and as much missile-armour as i could pack on. i'd declare war and release a fleet of those bad boys, and they'd rip through all the enemy fleets. usually with their fleets dead i would then proceed to invade their planets and conquer them, but sometimes they were crafty and would adapt their ship designs to counter mine. i sometimes even had the tides of war turn against me halfway through a war, since the ai built a new fleet of ships that would counter my current fleet of ships and make them obsolete. this whole arms race feature made warfare so cool and something i'd always have so much fun with in galactic civilizations. where is this in stellaris?

**ai**

i know this has been pointed out before but i didn't realize it extended to the military ai as well. the ai on the second highest difficulty is brain-dead. no one declares war on anyone. i'm the only one who declares wars. no ai has tried expanding into a single new system since 2250. they all expanded into the initial 10-15 systems and then stopped. they all have ""pathetic"" fleet powers compared to me. when i declare war on them they have almost no fleets that can threaten me, even when i attack multiple empires at a time. the only time i had an interesting/threatening battle was when i invaded an empire and he immediately hired a marauder mercenary fleet, since of course he had not built a single corvette himself. 

---

**tl;dr** so all in all, is it something wrong with how i play the game? should i play with dynamic difficulty? is it because of the poor ai with 2.2? are there any tactics to warfare that make it more interesting that i haven't been? what about ship design and fleet composition? they just all feel very bland and formulaic. "
167,"i've often toyed with a lot of tropes taken from games and movies. things from star wars, star trek, star control, warhammer, starcraft *jesus.. there's a lot of star-s*

one theme i tried once or twice but never got the hang of was the combine empire from half-life 2

https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/combine

the tl;dr of the combine is that they're an interdimensional empire that enslaves entire worlds and uses them as both a labor source as well as fighting units for their armies. they strip worlds bare for resources, and every time they conquer a world, they use it to add on to their empire for the next conquest.  kind of like the borg. but unique in its own way. there's no collective, it's just a giant pyramid scheme

the combine are led by a race called the shu'ulathoi, which are just giant grubs that have immense psionic powers and have pretty much evolved to the point of no longer having proper bodies, 

their planets are usually populated by slaves who have been hampered in some way, *neutering or nerve stapled*, and their armies are populated with synths,  but the half-life version of a synth is more like a grotesque cyborg, not an artificial person. they also use a lot of completely mechanical robots though, too.

think of army of flying mechanical drones and human footsoldiers augmented with so much tech they put darth vader to shame... backed up by something like an alien whale given armor and had engines and thrusters grafted onto its body, turning it into a cyborg troop carrier.



anyway. relevant to stellaris...  the trouble with trying to recreate this is that i feel they have aspects of all three of the main transcendence routes. i'm not sure which path to focus on, and still be able to acheive what i need to

psi - the ruler species must possess space magic.
cyborg - both the ruler species and their military forces are augmented with a lot of tech
biological - may need to combine biological and mechanical traits for the best results.



a lot of the things i want to be able to do are mutually exclusive, what do you suggest i focus on if i decide to start a new game like this?



i'm thinking of starting off with a heavy droid focus,  and using those robotic armies to subjugate a species... then i need to start modding the races into either killing machines or efficient workers, leaving everything else out.  no fun allowed.

i'm wondering with megacorporations,  if i can make use of penal or thrall worlds too, these weren't in the game the first time i tried it

while my ultimate goal would be to take over the galaxy with as little diplomacy as possible, i'd consider for early to mid game,   trying to bankroll myself with slave sales,  if it works.



** i'm thinking that cybernetic or biological focus would be the best. an the empire would best perform true to its theme as a authoritarian/materialist or a xenophobic/materialist/militarist.*

170,"i don't have time to play a lot since the update (preliminary exams for phd, yayyy) and i barely only played megacorp slavers up to the beginning and the crisis.


so that we are on the same page : with slavers you cannot have specialist planets. gotta have those worker jobs ! obviously, since domestic servitude is kinda shit, that means a whole lot of clerks in late game oecumenopolises. and your planet can be specialized, but not too much, there gotta be people working the mines and the fields you know !


but by lurking in this sub, it seems that specialised planets are the shit. or that the all around unspecialised economy of agricultural idyll is the shit (but for different reasons, mainly resource efficiency).or that unemployment build best build.
so there's variety, that got me curious and since my prelims have just started i must refrain myself from testing these out.


would those of us who figured out how not to crash their economy share their build ? how they got there ? how they maintain it ? is it resilient to planetary losses (slavers (and idyll i guess) are very resilient to planetary losses because of the all aroundness of your planets) ? what makes it special ? is it... fun ?

as long as your energy and mineral economy can handle you doing the initial crashing of the price of minerals, you can basicly have unlimited energy to spend on alloys to build a fleet to crash into an equal enemy and have the fleet rebuilt as fast as your shipyards can produce them

hell if you wanted to you could use a different resource, it would just take longer for you to initially crash the price of that resource"

180,"i was thinking about it today, and i realized how much i enjoy the feeling of crafting a peaceful, stable society in this game. there are planets in my empire that have never been touched by war, famine, unrest, or any kind of strife for that matter. there are trillions who will never go hungry, who will have good jobs, and places to raise their families. they will never want for anything. they are also, for the most part, free to do as they wish. they are not slaves or serviles, and can even experience different societies and empires if they wish to leave. but if they do stay, they will have a benevolent, in this case corporate, state to shield them from all the malevolent entities that lurk in the cosmos, seeking to do them harm. 

there was a machine uprising today that took down 4 planets before it could be pacified. none of those planets had ever experienced war of any kind, and it struck me how much of a disaster that would be in the real world, to have an entire planet upended like that. with the new pop rework comes a more realistic sense of scale, and i had never thought about my empires in these terms before, and i find that i really like it. i guess i'm not really sure why i'm making this post, other than just to lay this thought out and ask if anyone else has had similar feelings "
181,"for example if i want to have an empire centered around human refugees from earth living on an ocean world. humans can live there, but they'd rather be on a continental world.

an alternative could be a ""refugee regime"" ethic, where you could create an original home world kind of like how syncretic evolution lets you design a syncretic species. 

maybe both could work together, enabling your species to be native to a tomb world that used to be an continental world, but now live on a jungle moon somewhere."

191,"i'm not a big fan of mining and science stations. i guess in a way they allow players to develop their systems in a very basic way, yet they feel very needless. i want to care about the smaller parts of my empire, so that even if a relatively useless star system gets wrecked by a crisis, i still feel like some damage was done.

thus i have an idea; allow us to set up tiny colonies on uninhabitable celestial bodies (asteroids, barren planets and the like) that give the same resources as the stations give, but act more like a colony than a station. they could have pops, jobs and maybe even buildings, but be **very** limited in capability and size.

whilst this may seem very micro intensive, they could be tied to either colonies or starbases to keep things simple (summarizing their output rather than checking every single one), keeping them small and basic enough that they can be easily automated.

this would make me bother with invasions of minor systems, as i know there's something more than just unmanned stations there; actual pops of the empire, who would be lost/forced to flee if i let the system be destroyed."
192,"chemical bliss: +40% happiness, -60% resources from jobs, consumer goods 1.0/pop for every strata.

""resources from jobs"" modifier does not work for trade values, amenities, pop growth speed bonus, crime, naval capacities. so merchants, clerks, soldiers, and medical workers outputs don't get affected by this debuff. though clerks are workers class so 1.0 consumer goods is a bit waste (in normal living standards worker only consumes 0.1 ～ 0.4 consumer goods), but it might be good for other specialists and rulers jobs.

i'm like 150 years into a tall-ish playthrough, have been staying on 6 worlds for a long time, though i control a fair chunk of systems.  i'm ahead on tech with most of my neighbors, and that's won me a few defensive wars, but i'm way way behind on pop count.  

is there a point in the ""tall"" game where you just switch over and start spamming colonies down in your space?  previously i've just been taking the very best planets and terraforming when necessary.  i get that you want to keep your empire size down to rake in those phat techs, but at some point i feel like i'm gona need a shitload of alloy and not have it.  any serious threat like a khan or other big trouble would put my empire on it's ass and it'd take a really long time to recover."

is there some way around this that i'm not getting? i get that it's ""realistic"" for planets to keep growing, but this creates a lot of really awkward un-fun management. with the old tile system once a planet was filled it was filled and you could just kind of let it sit to focus on new/other stuff.

i have been playing a few games of 2.2 now and i have had 3 runs now in which one of my first neighboring empires had the same portrait as me, very similar ethics and different species traits. i never had that in any run i ever played before (i started playing a few month ago), so i was wondering if that's something you have met more often than before or if that's just rng?

on a side note, i don't complain at all as i find this very very cool! it's an interesting sci-fi trope (duros/neimoidians in star wars, vulcan/romulan in star trek) that i really like finding in stellaris!

edit: better with all the words"
198,"in the days since 2.2, a lot of us on this subreddit seem to be running into the same problem: it's next to impossible to get the pops you built to work a specific job working that job. the usual suggestion of simply allowing us to drag pops into a job seems a bit out of line with this update's design, so i wanted to suggest an alternative, one based on something i think we can all agree is a good thing:

blatant, systematic xenophobia.

the idea is to add a new dropdown to the species rights menu to control what jobs a species is encouraged to work. it wouldn't allow exact, down to the individual control - that's not what le guin seems to want us to do - but instead, it would allow us to encourage or restrict the species from certain categories of job. in practice, it might look something like this:

**employment rights**

* freedom of employment (default) - pops may work any job available, and will attempt to work the highest-stratum job available.

* systemic oppression - pops may be employed only as workers, and will displace other pops working these jobs. pops suffer happiness penalties.

* privileged status - pops may work any job available, and will displace other pops working these jobs. pops suffer happiness penalties at lower stratum.

this creates a relatively simple hierarchy; by default, pops will adhere to the existing system. worker pops, while perhaps not quite happy to be forced into a lower caste, will naturally drive out overqualified pops. any privileged species will naturally climb to the top of the ladder, allowing for the creation of a dedicated leadership caste.

this doesn't allow for fine-grain manipulation; a worker species will still need to be somewhat versatile, since you won't be able to control exactly where they wind up. but i'd argue that you shouldn't be able to - stellaris is a game about managing interstellar empires, after all. 

so, fine xeno scum of reddit, what are your thoughts on this idea?"
199,"as i expand my empire, i sometimes no longer need heavily fortified systems and so to save on the upkeep and cap, i will scuttle these bases. however, they were a huge resource investment and such a waste to simply dismantle. would be nice to have an option to shutdown a starbase, with a 3 months or so countdown for it to actually turn off, or back on when its needed again."
200,the labels are a mess.

202,"big economies thrive on added value; small economies wither away in an endless cycle of exporting raw resources. such are the cold hard facts of the global economy on planet earth (oil, precious minerals and other rarely occurring non-renewable resources aside). heavily processed goods and high-tech services yield a profit margin that is several orders magnitude greater than that of producing most ""common"" raw resources and agricultural products, and it is immediately intuitive even without a degree in economics (which i for one, by way of disclaimer, do not have).

&amp;#x200b;

if the global galactic economy in stellaris 2.2 is as realistic as it would seem to be, becoming a ""galactic japan"", a high-tech industrialized and urbanized economy with little to no indigenous raw resource production, should be both viable and incredibly profitable. i set out to test this theory with a tall xenophile corporate empire consisting of 3 urban planets and a very small handful of surrounding systems for the initial resource base. the idea was to acquire most of the low-margin raw resources (food and minerals) from the market, and turn them into high-value consumer goods and alloys to sell on the market at a significant profit margin. recognizing that rare resources are expensive to import, i resolved to produce them in-house, at least to a theoretical point where snowballing profits would make importing them a viable strategy. to avoid polluting the experiment with extraneous profits, i decided not to pursue any subsidiaries until late game. with the expectation of mad profits, i pressed start...

early in the game, my little empire was off to a good start, exporting consumer goods in large quantities for substantial profits, as expected. gradually, i started making friends and opening branch offices. soon enough i was sporting a highly functional economy despite producing a negligible amount of raw resources: between branch offices and massive urban population growth, industrial production and profits soared. with all the bonuses in place, my market fee was only 10%, further feeding the beast. my research was predictably well ahead of the ai empires (captain difficulty) and i had no trouble deterring any aggression with a powerful (if small) fleet and massive defensive stations at key chokepoints. life was good.

&amp;#x200b;

but amid this ode to corporate decadence, worrying macroeconomic trends started emerging. barely noticeable at first, price fluctuations on the market started having an appreciable effect on the economy of my ""japan in space"". by the time the total population my empire hit the 300 pop mark (that's 100 per planet), i was importing somewhere on the order of 400 minerals and 200 food from the global market, and exporting around 200 units of consumer goods and alloys total. at this point in time, well into mid game, the market started showing alarming trends whereby mineral prices shot up by some 30% and the price of processed goods plummeted by an even greater margin. it didn't happen overnight, but over the course of several decades my empire ground to a screeching halt: despite otherwise healthy growth, the profit margin disappeared and i was barely making ends meet let alone developing. even cranking out an ecumenopolis didn't help, as most of its districts require minerals to produce processed goods, and the lack of minerals an an accessible price was right at the core of the issue. at some point, the profitability of producing high-value processed goods for exports simply plummets at an exponential rate that the growing scale of production can no longer keep up with. all of this despite open trade with most if not all state actors in the galaxy that had been almost fully colonized.

&amp;#x200b;

in real life, several factors ensure that the global economy behaves differently from the galactic economy in my little experiment:

1. participants on the market perceive the growing value of resources in high demand and increase their production accordingly. considering that mineral production in 2.2 is flexible and can be ramped up or down gradually thanks to planetary districts, minerals on the galactic market ought to behave more like coal than like oil, in the face of highly elastic supply. this doesn't even necessarily have to be tied into other empires' mineral production as there are private actors on the market (we know this because the internal market exists before you meet other civilizations).
2. demand for processed goods, especially high-tech ones, is hard to fully meet in practice. consequently, higher volumes of production (within the realm of reason) hardly put a dent in the price. conversely, even relatively benign shortages of processed goods cause massive price hikes. for instance, take gpus (abstracted as ""consumer goods"") in this age of crypto mining.
3. the profit margin for most processed goods, especially high-tech ones, is several orders of magnitude greater than that of producing most raw resources and agricultural products, as i mentioned in the first paragraph above. however, in stellaris 2.2 the margin is much more narrow, so much so that routine resource price fluctuations have the potential to kill the profitability of the entire production operation. while plausible for a niche or a low-margin product irl, the ""consumer goods"" or ""alloys"" category abstracts a much broader market and thus as a whole it wouldn't be this unstable irl.

&amp;#x200b;

in summary, i have a suggestion to the devs: please consider adjusting the behavior of the galactic market to more closely match real-life markets including a greater profit margin for finished goods and a more elastic mineral and food supply (justifiable with private actors). then instead of being a no-brainer, pushing for autarky will become a trade-off that emphasizes self-reliance at the expense of some profitability. as this little ""space japan"" experiment clearly shows, right now it is autarky or bust, and it bothers me considering that global galactic economy was one of the focuses of the 2.2 update.

&amp;#x200b;"
203,"**population growth:**

growth right now is a little ridiculous, and this can become amazing or incredibly frustrating depend on how you look at it. on one hand you can stack massive bonuses to growth, but as your worlds get filled up this can add a lot of tedium as you have to handle overcrowding. there are some mechanics in place to handle overcrowding, but i don't think they were implemented very well and they're not all that great because it's almost always better to just ship your pops away to another planet. if you have no control over migration, then you're kind of screwed and better have a method to handle hurting your stability.

so, to combat this i'd like to offer a couple changes. right now i'll focus strictly on population growth. have population growth based on the availability of housing. the more housing you have available, the faster your pops will growth. conversely, the less housing you have the slower they'll grow. eventually once you reach 0 housing your pops will stop growing entirely.

in reality societies do reach a point where their population growth stagnates, so having this based on available housing wouldn't be a terrible idea. plus, it would make it so that you may always want some spare housing on worlds you want to continue to growth so that you have a steady supply to ship off to other worlds.

**population-related decisions:**

expel excess population can remain as-is.

declare population controls should change. as you shouldn't have to use it to stop your planet from growing, you can instead use it to stop individual species from growing. it should lose the -5 stability modifier and instead incur a -#% happiness malus on members of the species that are being suppressed.

declare drone controls will become obsolete and doesn't need to exist anymore with the previous changes.

**megastructures**:

right now the arcology project outshines every megastructure in the game. there's absolutely no reason to get any of them, especially the ringworld. arcologies come much, much earlier in the game and have a significantly greater impact on the game than all megastructures, though the ringworld stands out as particularly bad.

the name of the game is district efficiency. sure a ringworld gives you 200 districts, but those districts can only be city, energy and food. you can't have any mineral districts on a ringworld. further the districts are the exact same districts on a planet. finally, a ringworld takes 55k alloys (110k minerals) [165k in the live version] and takes nearly 60 years to complete. an arcology gives you insanely efficient districts at 20k minerals and 10 years!

so my proposal is not to just nerf arcologies into the ground. instead, we should give ringworlds a proper niche and give them better efficiency. instead of having 200 normal districts (which incurs the same admin cap penalty as normal planets for no gain), give us the following:

**each ringworld now has 25 district capacity instead of 50.**

ringworlds have the following districts:

**residential ringworld:** can be the same as the arcology. 15 housing, 5 clerks, 5 upkeep.

**generator ringworld:** 10 housing, 10 technicians, 3 upkeep.

**agriculture ringworld:** 10 housing, 10 farmers, 3 upkeep.

**research ringworld:** 10 housing, 10 researchers, 5 upkeep.

this is just my opinion, but with these changes we would give ringworlds a proper niche. they'd have less districts, but those districts would be far more efficient. they'd be a strict upgrade to agri-worlds and generator worlds, which for the insane cost you have to pay for them is entirely fair! they'd also have a solid niche for research.

also, one thing to consider is that ringworlds are built around a star. they ***should*** have the most efficient generators and the best farmers, because everything is essentially perfect conditions. as for the researchers? well, it's just something to give them a proper niche that doesn't strictly revolve around food and energy. otherwise they'd potentially remain useless.

finally, i am not sure if mastery of nature works on ringworlds. i would assume it doesn't. however, expansion and adaptability, plus that rare caravaneers offer should still work on them!

**bonus suggestion:** please for the love of all that is holy, give us a button to instantly transport all unemployed pops to a single destination, rather than having to click to each individual planet and scroll down to the bottom."
204,"the biggest problem i found with xeno-compatability is that it's a massive micromanagement *nightmare* if you've also gone with cyborgs/psionics. suddenly, your species list becomes obscenely huge; which is fine and dandy, except all the new pops don't spawn as cyborgs. if you want your whole species to be cyborgs with social welfare, you now have a problem: if you set the default rights to assimilate, they'll be made cyborgs but default to ""decent living conditions"" and you manually have to assign all the new pops to social welfare. and if you set the default rights to social welfare, you now have to manually cyborgize any new pops that are created.

&amp;#x200b;

this was always a problem with cyborg/psionic ascension, but was usually a minor issue. but the changes to immigration and *especially* xeno-coompatability make this go from a minor problem of managing a few species to a nightmare of managing over 20 or more seperate species' rights.

&amp;#x200b;

actually, now that i think about it, this is more of a problem with the species rights ui than xeno-compatibility. either way, there really should be a change; either a way to set assimilation followed by their rights afterwards (so you can have them assimilate, but if assimilation is impossible then social welfare/utopian abundance or whatever your choice of rights) or at least a band-aid solution of having half-pops always inherit the cyborg/psionic traits, so the issue would only be with completely new species from immigration."

206,i think i currently have about 29k fleet strength spread across 3 fleets. will that be enough? that system has 3 planets and i'm consuming 300 minerals per month which is annoying to sustain (i've got a ecumenopolis though so it isn't too bad).
207,"i had tried a mod some time ago, called cultural overhaul, which expanded the ethics of the government in a interesting way, such as the interest in the preservation of the environment (ecologist / industrial), or on what ethics is based their economy (individualist / collectivist), but it also reworked all the civics ( some interesting ones by the way like federalism or imperialism (so a more centralized colonization if i remember correctly)), which it wasn't i looking for. i'm ok adding new civic, but completely get rid if existing ones would be a shame .
 what i want to say is paradox has expanded the list of possible governments (especially with dlcs), but they left, i think, the ""ethical wheel"" too poor, i think enhancing  ethics options - without necessarily reworking the entire government and civic system - would be a good step forward for the basic game.

221,"i'm as new as everyone else to 2.2, but i'm also fairly new to stellaris in general.  i'm not even entirely sure what i did to wreck my economy or therefore how to fix it.  i've read dev diaries, and watched videos, but i'm still not 100% clear on how planets work now.  
  
so, enough ado... 

**part 1: what i think i did wrong**  
  
everything was trundling on smoothly, my metrics (energy &amp; minerals [no food; am robots]) were strongly positive with healthy reserves.  then i simultaneously colonized 7 planets.  then once colonization was complete i developed all the energy and mining sectors so i could ignore them while the planet populations grew with jobs waiting for them.  my energy and minerals all went negative and ate through my reserves in a few years.

**part 2: what i think happened**

i *think* you pay for jobs even when there's no one working the job.  since i developed all those sectors on all those planets i have tiny populations with an enormous surplus of jobs and i guess i'm paying for those empty jobs, while getting nothing in return for it.  also, and this i'm not sure about, is there some kind of hidden fee associated with colonizing a planet, or a basic planet maintenance fee which requires a minimum working population just to break even?  maybe i'm *waaaaay* over my administrative cap and it's killing me?  my empire is sprawling, and i think i saw a tooltip which said i'm at something like 475% of my administrative cap.

**part 3: what i've tried to do to fix it**

taking into account how i think jobs work, i am demolishing many of the sectors i just developed to reduce the number of surplus jobs.  i think i may also have too many alloy foundries now, eating into my minerals just as fast as i can mine them, so i'm swapping foundries out on various planets here and there with other types of buildings.  my energy and minerals are still pretty negative.

**part 4: what else can i do?**

what can i do?  should i make vassals out of some of the newer smaller planets i recently colonized?  i'm not entirely sure how that works, i only just started considering it about an hour ago after reading the wiki.  based on government/civics i'm not sure if this is an option though (gestalt consciousness/machine intelligence). i think i'd try just abandoning them if i could.  given enough time, if the new planet populations get sufficiently large, will the problem sort itself out?  not that this is really an option since i'm being invaded.  i'm waiting for the administrative cap research option to come up.  saw it a million times before, now i never see it.  meanwhile, i'm just running on empty, selling alloys/gas/exotics for credits/minerals when absolutely necessary.

**addendum**

there seems to be a fair bit of opacity when it comes to some mechanics in the game, or maybe i'm just not looking in the right place. 
  
earlier in this run, i got a communication from my next door neighbor, another machine intelligence.  if i hadn't noticed the tooltip on the hover-over with the communication alert pop-up i would not have even known the guy was trying to make me his vassal.  i clicked the pop-up.  the dialogue said something generic like ""i think it's time we made our relationship more formal."" decline or agree.  if i hadn't noticed the tooltip i would have had no idea what that was even about.  and even after i noticed the tooltip, the ramifications of declining or agreeing were nowhere explained.  i can't even be sure if he was demanding that i become his vassal, or requesting that he become my vassal.  
   
later, the same empire offered federation.  i was ok with that and agreed.  but again no explanation that i was going to lose 20% of my energy as a tax.  found that on the wiki. that put my energy in the red and so i quit the federation immediately, for -200 opinion.    
  
likewise with planet colonization.  i *suspect* there's something more going on with energy and mineral costs, but i don't know.  and the wikis haven't caught up yet.  
  
anyway, thanks for allowing me the opportunity to waste your whole day.
"
222,"so for this christmas i decided to treat myself with stellaris: galaxy edition.

before i buy:

1. to whitch directory does e-book install?
2. to whitch directory do the digital collectors book install?
3. what is galaxy forum for?
4. is it a good purchase? (this probbably needed to be the first point)"
223,"so to start with lets talk about the things that are good and bad about the changes to sectors in 2.2.

**good:**

1. sector ai is optional now
2. leaders are much easier to come by now.

**bad:**

1. de jure sectors sounded like a good idea but for whatever reason didn't work.
2. auto generating sectors is objectively worse than drawing our own in every way please do de jure or allow us to draw / redraw them.
3. sector ai is more brain-dead than ever; improving it should be a priority, as late-game empires are a nightmare to manage.
4. sectors still feel largely pointless for demarcating geographical, ethnic, political, or industrial regions. (this is huge for immersion) 

fixing them is something i have been thinking of for a while. here are some ideas

1. re-implement de jure sectors, i think the issue may have been that a lot of sectors had no planets which made some of the sectors useless, but perhaps we should look at untying governors from planets completely and retool some of their traits to be good for planet less sectors. 
2. **or** allow us to draw our own sectors again but this comes with the border gore of past versions returning so ymmv.
3. if we redraw our sectors manually give us a min / max number of systems that can be in a sector and maybe reduce the admin cost of systems in sectors, giving us a reason to use them and restricting their size means we may have good reason for carefully picking where and why we create sectors.
4. if there are de jure sectors untangling governors from planets would be a must.
5. add dynamics where ethical division arise, ie militarist tend to gather in this sector(just not 100%) and egalitarians in this one. just like in real life. "
224,"so, for egalitarian type societies: what is the best strategy for after a planet runs out of districts? full employment is easy, but what should we do with the homeless? 

i can't kill them. i can resettle them as long as i have room. what happens if i just let the overcrowding happen? will there be an automated resettlement for extra pops? or do i always have to manually intervene?

any other suggestions? i would prefer to avoid the population controls if possible. not sure my society will allow that anyway."
225,"hello,

so im a beginner at this game. i started a war, i conquered approximately 70% of their systems ( i mean i just destroyed their starbase thingies, couldnt do anything else ,build or sth). our exhaustion meters were always the same and in the end both were at 100% after i didnt lose any battle. the opponent kept making peace offers but with no interest for me, as it was a white treaty(no ground gains), so i though i would go as far as it would go.

so at one point it gives me only one option to make a peace treaty with no gains and the borders would be as we started with.

i found 2 habitable planets but i didnt attack them untill end, cause i thought i would do it later, even though i didnt make it in time.

with utopian abundance giving about twice the amount of pop trade value as decent conditions.

other observations:

\- shared burden seems to be on pair with academic privilege, but it is hard to quantify because it will lock you out of all the others except utopian.

\- happiness has no effect on the base trade created by pops.

238,"wouldn't a scenario editor to create custom galaxies be awesome. think something like map editors in other strategy games. it would be an editor where you get to randomly generate a galaxy or create one from scratch yourself by placing the stars. then for each star system you could generate planets or place or modify them yourself. you could add or remove features and deposits on planets, and place resources in the system. you could drag hyperlanes between systems and place megastructures and wormholes. 

and then you would add empires, what planets they start with and if there are any buildings/districts on those planets. you could modify the pops on the planet, the techs the players start with, etc. you could then lay out the diplomacy of the empires so that maybe some of them already know each other and are allied at the game start.

i know this might be a lot of work for them to make so obviously it wouldn't be a priority for right now, but imagine how cool it would be. players could create themselves custom galaxies to play in singleplayer or online, or they could share their own galaxies on the workshop. also it would make it so much easier for overhaul mods set in fictional galaxies to create their custom maps, such as star trek, star wars, mass effect, battlestar, star wars, foundation, star wars, halo, star wars, and star wars.

ok i'll be honest mostly i want this so that we can make star wars mods more easily, but other universes would be cool too. "

[terminal egress showing off the trade levels and protection possible.](https://i.redd.it/da1i4xuoin421.jpg)

trade routes are one of the more interesting mechanics in 2.2. that requires planning and a bit of strategy to keep your economy afloat. the two main threats to trade are piracy and long-routes (as in routes not protected by star bases) gateways utterly eliminate these issues and buff trade to absurd levels. 

trade routes can go through gateways. allowing an advanced gate network to funnel all trade into the captial directly. this also works with l-gates, allowing you to turn terminal egress (as depicted by this screenshot) into not only a transportation hub with a gateway but also a trade center. 

another interesting and honestly kind of broken aspect of this is how starbase protection is calculated with this. starbases can defend so many jumps worth of trade. this is upgraded by defense modules. requiring trade-forts along your routes to facilitate and protect trade. gateways count in these jump calculations. so a defense starbase linked to the gateway network count all other linked systems as one jump away. letting you stack protection extremely high. 

trade is a fun mechanic and this combo virtually eliminates the need for patrol fleets. try doing this as a mega-corp or trade focused empire and watch the credits roll in.

245,"robots used to be an area where you could really spicialize in. you could have robots with miner traits for miners, farming traits for farms and so on.

but now, the game automatically choose which pops it wants to build on a planet. there is no way for us to choose, which is not good.

sure, pops with certain traits might still get assigned work to the right field. but let’s say i create some robots to work in the unity field. i only want a few. but when i have that, there is no way i can tell the assembly line to stop and switch to another type of robots.

and the only way you can apply a template to robot pops is by converting **all** pops on a planet, which again eliminates specialization.

don’t know why this is but i really which we could have a choice. "
246,"title. essentially total wars should have to be fought until the bitter end; once you've captured all an enemy's planets they can only be force surrendered when the enemy has no fleet left; no shipyards to build more; and no resources to build a new shipyard.

258,"i got into stellaris roughly a week ago, tried humans on my first go and after a swift death decided to play machines. the next 5 tries as machines went pretty much like my human try with a stiff nosedive into extermination. but everytime i failed i learned a bit here and there and now i am at the year 2400 sth and have wars going for over 200years. so far it´s fun yet pretty slow. i will update this post with more accurate informations when i am back home to get some enlightment. here are some key aspects i learned over the course together with the game settings. 

* ironman 
* difficulty captain, it sounds ok and not too hard to start with. 
* 15-30 empires 
* huge spiral arm with 4 arms
* no win conditions - exterminate everything that is biological life. 
* exterminator machines 
* ai is on aggressive
* scaling difficulty or how that was called, will edit later. 
* involved in wars since 200years - bit more but i can´t remember when i started for real 
* pop is reaching 1k machines on sth, sth like 25planets 
* my energy and minerals fluctuated from +300 to -100 a few times while my food never went negative and is above 300 for the last 100 years - really? i have no need for food except converting it to energy. 
* my planets have no crime 
* i realised waay to late there is terraforming even when i had the tech relatively early. :o 
* i haven´t conquered any planet yet. orbital bombardment until it´s lifeless and send a colony ship is my way. how to make tombworlds btw? 
* round about 100years ago i nearly lost half my space to my neighbour because i underestimated his fleet but thankfully my citadels gave me enough time to rebuild my battleship/cruiser fleet to take my systems back. 
* resettling is a neat feature i wish i knew earlier - doh. 
* trying to conquer another machine empire isn´t as easy as purging biological lifeforms. i nearly lost due to this. if you rely on faith or how that ressource is called to keep your eco going it might not be the best idea to spend it on system claims. 
* i need to try to rebuild certain planets, can i bombard my own shit or somehow reform my planets? still a bloody noob and some of my planets are really bad. 
* fleets can take forever to respond when you control a huge empire. 
* i am afraid of the lategame crisis and whatnot. i have no idea about lategame but certain hints in the tech were there and made me scared. so i turned everything into a fortress. 24 citadels fully armed on key positions, 200/200 navy and heavily entrenched planetes except for the ""useless"" ones. maybe this is overkill, maybe it´s totally useless against the stuff that will come for me but i feel a bit better. 

edited ones below: 

* autobest to equip ships is something i have to look into. since i upgraded my battleships once i realised, it takes forever to upgrade a fleet of 10+ battleships and therefore i better make sure it´s the right stuff for the situation i am facing. what leads to the next point: 
* i really, really need to learn about equipment. so far i went armor if there is something like that but since my shield tech is getting up i might go hybrid. not sure if that works or not and how equipping works in general. the only thing i know is, there are different slots for different things. i guess i should look into this sooner than later. 
* if you don´t use auto setup for ships/starbase defenses you have to manually ""upgrade"" stuff before you can auto upgrade your ships. 
* if you expand to fast in terms of colonies you may break your economy because you stack penalties but don´t have the pop to utilize the planets. still need to figure out the details of economy though. 
* still don´t understand the tomb world thing. i bombard planets with armageddon/massive orbital bombardement stance, swipe any pop on the planet and yet it never turns into a tomb world. 
* running combined fleets might not be the purest min/max but it´s fun for sure and i can satisfy my rp way better. :) 
* if you made planet decision to fight crime you better remember them or your eco/growth will suffer harsh! resettling pop to the planets is nice but with the penalties going it´s painful. 
* edicts are such game safers for me! 

&amp;#x200b;

it´s getting slow, like really slow now but it´s still a blast and coming from turn based strategy games i know how to kill my time during the long periods of waiting. and for now i can actually read all the things ingame to figure out stuff. so i don´t care for the game slowing down so much. last but not least, i am having a blast so far. the game is difficult so far with tons of stuff to learn and since i just jumped in without any tuts (except the ingame one) i fucked up a lot of things and i am certain i have fucked up even more things i don´t know about yet. 

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

edit: some more things i forgot to throw on the list. next ingame evolvment update in roughly 12hours. 

edit2: is the tomb world thing bugged? not playing any beta if there is any. just the vanilla game as steam delivered it. but bombarding planets until there is no life left doesn´t turn them into tomb worlds from what i remember. i tried to so since my conclusion was ""bombard until it´s 100 devastated"" but when i saw there was still life/pop on the planet i kept bombarding until everything was gone but the planet is still no tomb world. need to double check when i am home but i am pretty certain. i want tomb/ machine worlds. :/ 

edit3: 

i am at 2500years now. constant war is raging the spiral arm and i am at war with every remaining species except for 2 machine fractions who are spared for now. hunter killer drones (corvettes) seek and harrass my enemies and try to disrupt trade routes while my main fleet is slowly crawling from system to system swiping every habitated planet in their path. waging war for over 300years now helped to re-adjust my fleets and turn the auto setups off. 
no more wasting ressources on inferior tech, that´s something for the humanoid races. 
the process of turning conquered worlds into machine worlds is is in full progress but tomb worlds are still a mystery to us - might need to adjust our logical routines to be successful here. but there are more important things to do for now.

1. i declared tributary war on ai, which had one defensive pact, however this bot couldn't take part in battles because his borders were blocked by another empire.
2. i couldn't achive wargoals, because ai defending my future tributary still had quiet big army i couldn't destroy (because of another empire's border blockage), so i wasn't getting points for relative power.
3. i conquered all empire's planets and starbases, i just didn't manage to take last 4 star systems before exhaustion.
4. now neither status quo triggered by me, nor the automatic one after 2 years exhuastion created a new tributary.
5. (bonus) just after status quo the ai that had defensive pact with ai i tried to conquer immediatly vassalizes it. just screw me.

my question: do you have the same problem? how do i vassalize someone if i can't achive wargoals because of too many defensive pacts?

im playing on newest beta branch 2.2.2 (555a), all dlc's included.

is this working as intended or a ""bug""?

[edit: this is the current situation](https://i.redd.it/b3uyyymesu421.png)"
270,a question - can vassals make research/commercial agreements with other empires? 
271,"voidborn used to make you feel like you actually wanted the majority of your species to live in space. going about spamming around all these great o'neill cylinders and stanford tourai with research labs and solar generators, along with the inefficient asteroid mining bays and agricultural zones. it didn't really matter that they were inefficient because they were unique and cool and spacey.

that's kinda the heart i want to get it. it doesn't matter if something is balanced or not, it could be horribly inefficient so long as its cool factor is through the roof. right now, even when i'm trying not to, i play habitats out exactly [the same way](https://i.imgur.com/6dhqf2a.png): 3-4 habitation districts + 4-5 trade districts. the science just isn't good enough for what i could be doing on a planet floor and because building slots are basically king in 2.2, getting the maximum number of jobs and housing is the priority above pretty much all else.

so.. uhm.. suggestion one: cap the building slots to about half of the current and the whole hab better.

8 buildings, or really just 7 because you can't have a colony without a capital. even if you minmaxed (which you absolutely don't want to do because habitats don't get bonuses for being specialized) the most you can get is 85 comfortable housing. 85 pops working jobs that are better done elsewhere with resources that only come planetside (minerals, energy) and no amenities. so their building slots are best spent on things you'd like but wouldn't want to 'waste' on a planet. in other words, habitats are best used for the refinery jobs. mote making and the like.

which means that you probably get about 35-45 housing slots of which you can fit in around 40-60 pops depending on things like slaves and robots and the rights of your people and how communal they're feeling at any given time. erring on the side of caution, a cap of 8 slots makes sense here, but what to put in it?

as i mentioned before, right now habitats kinda naturally fall into refineries. pretty much all slots go into turning minerals into rare resources. it's more fun if that doesn't happen. it's more fun if there's variety and distinction. so i propose that habitats get better refineries (+2 jobs instead of +1) and we bring back the old interesting if unupgradable buildings.

the goal should be to get a species that can live only in space if they so choose. so let's come up with buildings that lead to a thriving, self-sustaining, space culture. (one with master builders.)

standard build:

4 housing districts

1 capital (5 housing, 3 jobs)
1 mote (2 jobs)
1 gas (2 jobs)
1 crystal (2 jobs)

total jobs: 9
building slots left: 4

with that, we can specialize. we want about 45 housing and 45 jobs for ~45 pops.

4 other districts which we're allowed to use for whatever.
4 building slots which we're allowed to use for whatever.

36/8 = 4.5 = everything should give between 4 and 5 jobs. let's say 3 to 6 so that players have an interesting puzzle to work out if they want to maximize employment and have places to fill if their pops are mostly droids.

all districts should then give 4 or 5 jobs, you don't want a repeat of the situation where i'm not building research and leisure districts just because they don't give enough jobs. they should be specialized for the occasion. i want to make use of the pretty art the budget came up and we've already got precedent for high value districts that cost no rare resources with ecumonopoli foundries and industries.

a science specialized habitat would then create 20 researching jobs. considering maxed out, still balanced, tech-worlds can manage more than 60 research jobs, this doesn't strike me as overtly overpowered. sure you're saving about 8 gasses a month, but you're also building a whole new thing devoted to this; seems like a good balance pay off.

in this scenario, we get 16 jobs left spread across 4 building slots. first, we'll keep specializing into science with a research director. then we'll grow food to make the habitat self sustaining, so we bring back two space food building at 4 jobs each (and let's say it produces some small amount of amenities because who doesn't love visiting gardens and parks when you're in space? plus we need more cool factor).

6 base * 8 jobs = 48 food. more than enough to sustain in space.

one building left. we're still running a mineral, power, consumer goods, and alloy deficit because we've specialized into science. we're probably running low on amenities, too, since we didn't go in clerking. we probably do want a gene clinic, though. probably even as our first building to get pop growth up at the start. so we'll keep that running until we replace it at the very end when the habitat is full up and done with a galactic market or something, then feel really bad because we should have fit a leisure district in so all those scientists had a place to go after a busy day of sciencing. 

so there, space science. 45 pops, 43 jobs, balanced between rare resource gen and science gen with only a little rioting. at least until the criminal empire moves in and you've got to throw some enforcers at the problem. but hey, one crisis at a time, right?

for other builds, such as industry and forging, it makes sense to build far more housing. since each building can cap out at 8 jobs (as of the current beta patch), more density just works out for them. it would be best to have unique buildings for mostly everything there. going with an idea that living in space only needs the standard resources instead of the rare ones while rare stuff is only for those planet bound plebeians, but one art budget at a time.

i think taking this suggestion would give players access to more choices and start to feel like a life in space might actually be viable as a long term endeavor. plus you get access to the cool buildings and coolness is really what we're aiming for anyways.

cool habitat unique buildings that we already have art for that we aren't using:

[astro mining](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/images/2/24/building_hab_astro_mining_facility.png): 3 jobs

[agriculture parks](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/images/2/2b/building_hab_agri_bay.png): 4 jobs

[solar power wings](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/images/b/b1/building_hab_solar_power_processor.png): 4 jobs

changes to districts so they feel worthy of the name district:

science district: 5 jobs

leisure district: 4 jobs

trade district: 7 jobs (it's mostly already there just to fill empty jobs)

reactor district: 6 jobs (because robots should be able to live in space sustainably.)

---

suggestion two: give players access to as many build slots as you're willing to ever give them right off the bat.

it's extremely silly to have all the building slots unlocked and used in a non-minmaxed habitat right now. you get no amenities, no bonuses for specializing, and extreme eating of minerals. it's possible to not want players to get into a situation where they're trying to make 85 jobs work on a tiny habitat so just disallow it. instead, make it so they're allowed to use all building slots the moment the habitat is colonized.

it would be unique. it would be cool. and it would help with that almost effervescently elusive quality of verisimilitude. building slots being locked away by population makes sense on a planet; it represents the collective infrastructure of the surface made by those living on it coming together for a nice place to put a government sponsored complex.

but on habitats? you build the whole thing already. what's really stopping you from putting as many buildings as you can physically fit in there? the answer should be nothing! because it's cool. space cool. makes habitats unique and since it's already meant to a fully developed shell that only needs our imagination to fill it, getting to see the edges of the canvas before you start painting is just icing on the ""make habitats unique"" cake. all without ever really being overpowered.

in fact, in a lot of ways, it's a nerf. a cool nerf.

---

suggestion three: have habitats start settled the moment they're finished building.

in the early days of pre 2.2, it made a lot of sense to have to settle habitats on your own. once you decided to settle, you then had to put down the capital and by passing that would remove some player agency, even if it never gave players a meaningful decision to being with. now, settlement is just about choosing a species to start with.

since there's basically no situation where you wouldn't want to immediately settle a habitat you just built, why not bypass the whole process? it's been in your skies for years, everyone knows about it, it was purpose built for life. why not have it start settled? i know i'd feel cool if the moment a habitat was built it became usable. habitats gain something unique just from that moment alone and, well, i love habitats and i want others to, too."
272,"i just had an empire i declared war on to be a subsidiary at 100% war score for years and had taken over his entire space.

273,"the alien vials don’t do the same thing anymore, they give unique traits that don’t effect your points. i haven’t seen anyone talk about them and i thought you might want to know what they do

blue gives limited limited regeneration, it increases lifespan by 5 years and army damage by 5%

green increases habitability by 5%

and red decreases pop housing usage by 5%

"
274,"so, first off, lovin' le guin, my exalted priest xenofile free haven shrrooms haven't a blast protecting refugees from genociadal empires, and exacting retribution not withstanding.

&amp;#x200b;

that said, i think once we get past the initial bug squashing of 'literally unplayable' issues with 2.2, there will be a greater need for more sensible improvements.

&amp;#x200b;

to that end, i'm hoping that in addition to some new content, the next expansion should really take what we've had here and come over it well, and work to implement a lot of quality of life improvements. not just ai, but more toggles, policies, check boxes, menus, and charts! all the little things that can really help players find what they need, when they need it, and reduce excessive clicking. 

&amp;#x200b;

for example, something that would be nice is a full-screen window that shows more detail than the current planet and sector window: something where i could, for instance, select a decision and have it applied on all planets selected and then a 'send order' button to activate it all at once.

&amp;#x200b;

perhaps the ability to sort the planets on a variety of factors (specific outputs, populations, etc), a detailed ledger.

&amp;#x200b;

etc, etc, you all get the idea. i think there is room to add new content along with it, but i think this would be a great filler expansion before the big diplo update of 2019/2020."
275,"traits
the new meta seems to be pop growth.

however there are a lot of modifiers around. the +-0.3(10% of 3.0) growth doesn't seem that strong/bad for 2 trait points. maybe if it would modify the base value instead it would be better (base of 3.3/2.7) . as a hive you easily collect +150% and more. better on robots then on organics as they get +15% for 1 point. 

habitability costs you 0.25% production and 1% of pop upkeep and amenity usage per point you are under 100. the food upkeep is not that bad considering how easy it is to come by. amenities can get expensive.

there is 20% from techs and 10% from traditions if you are purifier/inward/hive. the traits are 10%/20% for 2/4 points.

considering that how strong planets are and that they have at most 80% habitability that is quite strong. 

the 15% from * job traits i'm not sure what i'm to think about them. they are better now then they where in 2.1 as a bigger part of your eco comes from planets. the thing is that only a (small) part of your population will be in jobs where that is useful.

strong and very strong are just eh. +2% worker for a point is in the don't care realm. +5% for 3 is weak. army damage is don't care again. you make invasions a bit harder but armies are too cheap to care if i lose some. just throw more at the problem. if you loose in space you will lose on the ground. the only question is how long you are going to get bombed first.

-housing is nice for a point. the big thing is that you get a net gain of housing from districts. nice to have but not that strong i think.

conservationist is also nice. nothing more to say about it.

government ethics was never that much of a problem for me.

nomadic lets you transfer more growth between planets.

i think it is again at +leader traits.

negative 

fleeting hurts. hives less then other organics as there leaders are younger.

slow learners costs you leader development. luckily you seldom need a minimal level anymore. 

nonadaptive cost you basically 2.5% production and increases upkeep. bad. but gets you 2 points.

decadent easy pick if you minimize the political power of workers and slaves.

i don't have strong opinions about the others. 

civics

agrarian idyll ensures you don't have to build cities like ever and provides amenities. but arcologies are strong.

mining guilds get you +1 minerals per miner. the bonuses apply on that. so it's a multiplicative 20% bonus. nice.

shadow council is very weak.

distinguished admiralty gets you fire rate. good pick, but not early game. i think.

efficient bureaucracy is also good. once you filled the cap that is +6% science and 10% unity. better deal then beacon of liberty.

slaves are nice to have. thrall worlds are also strong.

shared burdens is thematic but weak.

i don't care much about the rest.

after i won the war i created a vassal from the captured planet and gave land to the areas that i conquered since i didn't want to deal with it. from what i remember it changed quickly to that after i made the vassal.

294,"came back from a long break after a friend convinced me to play with him after megacorps came out. played a few games as megacorps then wanted to try out devouring swarm. as a corp i built tall and never really went over my cap for systems and all that (can't recall the technical name for it right now). as a ds i've been waging war on almost everyone i meet and it automatically takes their stuff, from this i'm now almost double my cap. if i recall correctly you used to be able to correct this by making sectors. now i realize sectors are made automatically, but still have no idea how to 'make' these sectors or manage them properly. tried to look at guides, reddit posts etc but haven't had much luck, so here i am. what am i doing wrong here? all of my current sectors have governors, but don't seem to take away from my cap. is this how it is now?"
295,"in general it'd be nice if the new expansion pack made more economical sense, to make the price of goods actually correspond to the galactic market, and not just how much you sold or bought something. and as it has been mentioned before in this subreddit, graphs would be amazing, so that we could actually see what's going on, and what your problem is.

don't get me wrong this is my favourite expansion pack and free update, but there are just a ^(few) mistakes"
296,"at first i was pretty confused but i started to get the hang of it. all of this diplomacy, balancing of resources, trying to advance research, finding habitable worlds, etc was fun.

then i discovered devouring swarm. no more worrying to negotiate with other species, caring of their opinion of us, dealing with factions, consumer pops, etc. now my only goal is to spread out and find more food, conquering and devouring. any challenge we face, we can mutate and adapt to overcome it. no matter the habitat we can infest it.

on top of that our economy is doing really well, being mostly food based. as long as we are chomping down on one species or another, we have all the credits we need. which means we can expand our military even further.

so far i've taken over a good chunk of the galaxy and am looking to continue spreading and taking over more and more territories. i've just learned that i can apparently also mutate what i am feeding on. i am thinking about making cattle worlds where we have species there that have been mutated to rapidly reproduce and to be more delicious."

299,"i... hm.

let me start by saying i love stellaris. i enjoy the game immensely, i have, as of now, 877 hours on it. i love playing it in my free time.

i have also bought every dlc the game has, including megacorp. they've all been fun, and i don't regret any single one of them (well, maybe plantoids, but they came in a pack).

that being said, the game is ***fucking broken*** right now. it is, and i'm not joking, borderline unplayable. the megacorp release has brought a new economic system, which i thoroughly enjoy, but that economic system also brought an entire new web of bugs. some mildly annoying, some infuriating, some gamebreaking. none addressed by paradox thus far.

do i mind? no. will i keep playing stellaris despite of how broken it is right now? absolutely.

so what exactly *do* i quit?

well.

**i quit the community**.

over the years it's been fun around here. discussions, banter, memes, mods... it's been the only sub i actively participated in. but after 2.2? it did a full 180 into a hivemind.

complaining about the state of the game i paid, now, over 200 dollars? unacceptable, i'm a noob.

pointing out bugs or oversights? i'm dumb, intended behavior, i'm a noob.

pointing out the ways the new system could be improved? ""dude, why do you even play the game then"".

it's ridiculous. it's unacceptable. it's autistic. it's sad.

it really saddens me to leave you all here, but honestly - i care more about my own mental health than i do about your opinion on the game. you can fanboy all you want, i don't care anymore. i'm just gonna hope that paradox does indeed fix the game, instead of listening to this echo chamber you've created.

it was a fun ride, but i can't say i'll miss it. the crash left me disfigured.

i won't be responding to anything on this sub anymore. i hope you'll have fun yourselves though."

301,"since updating to 2.2, i've had a repeating occurrence where i am forced to end a trade deal due to lack of resources. however, the top bar indicates that i have plenty of resources to continue the trade deal. for example, i am trading 23 minerals monthly for 8 alloys monthly, and i have a monthly gain of 30 minerals while the trade deal is still active. the forced break doesn't occur in the first month of the deal and doesn't coincide with construction of new buildings or districts on my planets. any ideas why this is happening?"
302,"hi so i'm new to the game and my first pick was a lovely ds hive mind.

my first play i had to stop around the 40ish year, because i was totally recourse starved, especially energy.

 

in my new one i am at year 70 atm, have already consumed 3 empires and for the most of it i am very satisfied so far.

i concentrated early on only generator districts and food district if needed. i'm not good in food but my consumption rate in planets keeps me alive. if i consume a planet i shift around the newly acquired ""food"" to my other planets and it keeps me at a relatively stable growth. although it requires a lot of energy and a huge chunk of my reserves go into relocation.

my fleet is close to cap and pretty much every empire by it self is inferior to me.

how ever i start running into new problems and would like some input on how to combat them best.

&amp;#x200b;

1. as i understand it, as a ds i can not divide my empire into vassals, so i'm about 150% admin cap atm and i started to slow down my conquering process. how do i deal with empire size in the long rung? i mean if i am supposed to devour every empire, sooner or later i will cover most of the galaxy. how do i drastically scale up my admin cap?
2. on my planets i usually built spawn pool, maintenance, maintenance, science and in between generators and food. i have hardly any building slots or free jobs for alloys or rare recourses. what is a good way to specialize a planet to build more high tech buildings?
3. in most lets plays i have seen ppl play the blue laser to uv laser route. i  went for rail and auto guns, because they poped on early and i had better things to research in physics. is there a huge difference in weapon choice concerning late game or is it more of a personal choice thing?
4. at what point in game am i ready to take on the marauder empires? so far i always paid them of but it got expensive lately and they kind of annoy me.

i would appreciate any input, critic or improvement.

306,"hello. 

so, i'm having issues with slaves with my slavers guild empire. 

 i had some slaves on my capital, which i'm turning now into a research specialized planet. i destroyed the districts to free workers so they could turn into specialists, but my slaves didn't turn into specialists. so now i had several unemployed slaves, and i couldn't ""free"" those pops, they were slaves no matter what. because of this i made a few gen districts, so they started working and weren't unemployed anymore. everything great so far, all worker/slaves are working and i have a few available specialist jobs for new pops.

the problem starts when the new pops are new slave pops, that since there are no jobs for slaves in the planet, just become unemployed. what this is basically doing is that i can't specialize my planets, since there will always be new slave pops and they cant be un-slaved (like before, you just dragged them to a building like research and they stopped being slaves), i'm forced to always have worker jobs in my planets.

i absolutely love the most recent update, the addition of corporations imo is marvellous and adds a whole new way to play; but one feature i absolutely can’t stand is the gosh darn automatic sector feature. now i’d be more than happy if sectors automatically created *then* you got the ability to chop and change them. but it seems there’s literally nothing i can do about these weird as fuck sector borders that prop up with every colonisation- sometimes i get one planet sectors which is honestly infuriating when the only planet in said sector is a 10 sq world. 

i fully appreciate the way that managing planets themselves has been changed but i can’t wrap my head around this sector change it seems very nonsensical.

so i guess what i’m asking you all is:

1. am i the only one who feels this way/is the new sector system liked?

2. if i’m missing something and i can actually edit my sectors in 2.2 please tell me?

3. can anyone direct me to a mod that will allow me creative control over my sectors/ eliminate them altogether?"

312,"it's really just a showerthought that came up while i was playing stellaris and recalled interstellar. if there existed a race of beings capable of traveling interstellar distances and had the means to communicate instantly could that empire actually exist? if you talked to someone on earth from an interstellar distance and your communication seemed to be at the same time, the moment you'd end your call and call them back, a few hundred years would've already passed back on earth.

how could any species create an empire that exists on an interstellar plane when planets themselves are operating with time zones so far removed from one another? policy, technology, trade, travel would all be impossible.

313,"specialized planets such as the thrall world, penal colony, resort world, and ecumenopolis were all great additions in 2.2/megacorp and i think there should be more. i really like the idea of a world like the thrall world for machine empires that is expensive to maintain and does not allow resource districts or regular buildings but has tons of replicator jobs. late game you have one of these in the middle of your empire pumping out all your robomodded pops to distribute throughout your empire. for balance reasons maybe lock it behind an ascension perk like only allowing machine worlds to be converted into one, though it could be justified having it be its own perk like the arcology project as machine empires have a single perk ascension path while others have 2. even organic hives have two bio ascension perks and hive worlds. hive and machine worlds aren't even the equivalent to the arcology project, they're terraforming projects that replace gaia. gestalts really don't have a special planet decision. i don't know what hive's would be but i really like this one for machines."

* automatically disassemble existing robots (this has not happened)

before this patch, starbase expansion had a negative effect on research speed, giving it a global negative percentage. with 2.2, it seems research speed is quite slow in comparison, but i do not see a modifier reflecting starbases.  


has this effect been entirely removed from the game? has it been replaced with the admin cap? if so, how exactly? i only had about 75 hours in stellaris before 2.2 dropped, so i could definitely be missing something.

337,"so i am using my mass effect races replacers mod available in steam workshop. and i am using my build - xenophile pacifist spiritualist, free haven and meritocracy. species traits are charismatic and venerable but slow breeder, slow learner and weak. it is a democracy and thessia is continental.

huge galaxy, 3x tech costs, 1.5x habitable worlds.

so it is something like a une game but with spiritualists.

the asari are very handicapped at the beginning as slow breeders. but they are very suitable for a xenocollection game. charismatic means they produce so many amenities and get a strong immigration pull. free haven makes growth by immigration increased. 

i settled my main border with 3 continental colonies and have my empire sprawl just slightly above admin cap. seeking alliances are actually easier in le guin as we can just rival the rival of our neighbours without having to be neighbours ourselves. in this game, rivalling the turians who were a quarter of the galaxy away from us secured the alliance with systems alliance. the humans are nomadic so my main aim was to drain their pops to my planets. since we also prefer continental, the humans couldn't resist.

i only needed to aid them one defensive war and that's it.

after a few decades, it is actually not difficult to stay near the top. i now only have 1.8k fleet power, a hundred years in. compared to systems alliance, they have around 4k. but both my technology and economy are above average quite a bit. so, basically just keeping a small fleet like that and with the technological and economical advantages, other empires can respect us.

i still have 4 different planets within my borders that i may colonise but have held back. the proof of concept is that we only just need a handful of colonies to sustain a respectable position and it is not a loss to not colonise incompatible planets.

and it was different in niven, as back then it was definitely a loss if we didn't settle every single rock.

if you have questions about concepts about this playthrough, feel free to ask. this is oddly inspiring and therefore my sharing here. thank you for reading."

this is the first time i declared war on someone and i'm really confused on how all this works. i started a vassalisaton war with a xenophobe empire, i destroyed their fleet, occupied all their planets, i destroyed the fleets of the alies, had them on 100% war attrition for ages until mine grew to 100% as well. now apparently i'm being forced to make peace in 2 years. what the heck? i lost 2 corvettes in this entire war. do you need to blow up planets to win wars in this game?

i have a tip that increases ticks per second on most setups and that is effective due to the way the game engine is setup:

&amp;#x200b;

reduce all detail settings to low and turn off all special effects (bloom etc).

i managed to almost double my tics per second in my medium galaxy, year 2400+.

&amp;#x200b;

""but my gfx card is a beast and can handle the game perfectly well"" i hear you say. so indeed was my machine, but this works because the main thread is loaded in stellaris with mixed functionality and the engine architecture is old.

&amp;#x200b;

by removing the rendering features and detail, you have less dx calls and passes from the engine. even if your gfx card can handle them easily, it's still a pass that sits on the main thread eating cpu time that the game could use to do whatever it's doing (bugs and all) and is not a factor of how expensive your gpu is or how much ram you have.

&amp;#x200b;

let me know your results.

use this as well: even in the beta patch the issue still exists. and this is more pronounced in vanilla if you're playing a trade empire (i do, ais do as well)

350,"2 really promising games in a row cut short. there's just no chance when you are boxed in, playing tall pacifist megacorp, and find a fucking devouring swarm with like 4 planets already full that instantly war decs you with fleets 10x what you have.

351,"essentially, i haven't played stellaris more than a couple times since 2.0 launched, and a bunch of friends roped me into a small, almost modless game.

- it's taking place on a small galaxy, about 100 stars using a mod, with seven people playing including me

- none of the other mods are much more than small cosmetic things, like downscaled ships

in my singleplayer game, i took the civic that started you on a gaia planet as a test to try and play tall, but it crippled my expansion and i'm not sure it was worth it, even with the low amount of stars.

is there any advice on this so i don't get crushed fifty years in? i've tried one singleplayer game in the new update, and i'm learning the new systems fairly well, but alone, i'm not sure it'll be enough. i really don't want to play aggressively, and i'd prefer to hunker down and focus on being as powerful defensively as possible, building up a lot of research and economy. however, i'm encountering serious problems with getting the population i need and building an economy."
352,"**i'm talking about the robot part of gestalt consciousness, my mistake for the confusion.**

i did a normal empire game to test the new expansion, then moved to a good ol' determined exterminator game, but i found a lot of problems:

1. lack of energy, which forces you to either take +% credits or use the policy that increases credits &amp; minerals. i don't remember pre 2.2 being so energy consuming for gestalt.

2. alloys: because the policy above will reduce your alloy production, you are now forced to take superconductive. i know in 2.2.2 they increased alloys so that might solve it.

3. **the main problem: pop growth speed. it takes 100 months (over 8 years) to get a new pop** on a new colonized planet (vs 34 on starting planet) and the robot factory building is beyond bad because it only gives 1 robot builder work.

 i've tried relocating pops but i don't think it's really worth it. even with rapid replicators or any other pop grow modifier, its still too slow.

 also the assimilation of organics could give a few more credits or last longer. it consumes a pop every 5 months and they give 4-5 energy each each month.

 either robot factories need to be buffed or gestalt needs a new and faster way to get pops that is not driven assimilator.

"
353,"my robots are specced into being good miners. they live in servitude with no rights. when i saw some were taking doctors while i still had organics in the mines i tried to fix it. after some meddling i have 2 unemployed specialists and 5 robot doctors who take up the slot anytime i try to fill it despite not being unemployed when i open it. can pops be manually removed? the robots immediately fall back into mining jobs when i get rid of the doctors

&amp;#x200b;"
354,"i've seen that people aren't very sure of how trade, piracy, protection, and routes work, so i thought a detailed overview might be useful.

**trade** is found in space, and produced by colonies.

any upgraded star base will collect all trade in the  system it's in, and increase the system's piracy protection. 

any **trade hub** will extend **collection range** by 1. in 2.2.1, the collection range simply counts jumps. *in the beta branch, trade collection won't go through wormholes or gates, and is bugged (cut off) in some systems*. collection from range is *not* subject to piracy. 

**offworld trading company** will add 2 trade for every hub on that base.

all the collected trade is sent from the collecting starbase to your trade capital, via **trade routes**. these are normally generated automatically, but can be set manually from the **trade interface**, which is accessed either from the starbase tab, or from the **trade map mode**. automatic trade routes avoid forbidden systems, and tend to daisy-chain stations, which means that, in a very large empire, stations close to the capital will have huge amounts of trade. trade routes can even go through other empires, as long as both ends are your stations. trade routes *can* and *do* go through wormholes and gates. theoretically, you can have a zero-piracy end game setup by having a gate in every hub system.

any system in your empire has a **base protection** of 2, which means that 2 total trade value is protected from piracy. this can be increased by 5 with a tradition. any trade *along a route* will increase piracy in all systems the route passes through. with time and trade, the pirates grow in power until they spawn a hostile fleet. any trade along a route is cut off by hostiles in a system. this goes for all hostiles, not just pirates, so remember to forbid systems with leviathans and mining drones, if you rely on auto pathing for trade routes.

**trade protection** is increased by defense modules on stations: gun and missile emplacements increase protection value by 10 each, hangar bays by 20. all of these also increase protection range by 1. piracy can also be decreased by fleet and base presence.

given this, the setup for minimum piracy is to have dedicated trade stations, all hubs, that cover most, if not all, sources of trade, and dedicated defense stations, prefferably on choke points, that cover most, if not all, of your routes. remember that you can redirect routes for better coverage. having all high-trade planets in range of your capital station keeps piracy risk very low.

the ""specialized bases"" setup is much better than going half-and-half, because a base with 1 defense module protects at most 3 systems of a trade route, one with 3, 7, one with 6, 13!

any systems with uncollected trade, or insufficient protection (red pirate icon on the trade map) can just get an achorage built in them, and that will take care of the problem. if you can build just one more base, it's better to use it to collect than to protect, because you can protect with your fleets. if it's just one system with piracy risk, you can just put a few naked corvettes in orbit, if there are several, it's better to set a fleet to **patrol** just those systems.

trade needs to reach your capital to be used, so you absolutely need an upgraded base in your capital system. once it is collected, trade is converted to energy, and optionally to consumer goods or unity, depending on **trade policy**. this also dictates what you get from **trade deals**, namely 10% of the other empire's collected trade, converted according to policy.

please add your comments, and mention anything that i may have forgotten.
"
355,"having a planet with predominantly chemical plants, exotic gas refineries or synthetic crystals plants buildings provides the world with +5% advanced resources output from jobs. the problem i'm seeing is that each of these buildings provide only 1 job each. since each building slot requires 5 pops, what do you do with the other 4 pops to keep them working, but not remove the +5% advanced resources planetary bonus.

&amp;#x200b;

the building that provides the most jobs is the tier 2 commercial zone with 10 clerks. it feels wrong though to waste a building slot like that on what is supposed to be a specialized world though. that means building districts.

&amp;#x200b;

we want 75 pops to unlock the 16th build slot. that means we have 15 strategic resource buildings with 15 pop jobs. we need something for our 60 other pops to do. that's a lot of unemployment! we need 15 city districts to house these 75 pops. that gives us 15 clerk jobs (30 with the interstellar franchising tradition).

&amp;#x200b;

# without prosperity

we're looking at 3 admin jobs, and 2 enforcer jobs from the planetary capital. that means we still need to find \[75 pop - 15 strat resource - 15 clerk - 3 admin - 2 enforcer\] = 40 more jobs for our pops. we will need 75 amenities (assuming no upkeep modifiers), so we need \[75 - 8 from planetary capital - 30 from clerks - 9 from admins\] = 28 more amenities.

&amp;#x200b;

if we get our two housing techs, cities provide 7 housing, so we could go 9 cities plus 6 resource districts for our 75 pops. that's only giving us 16 jobs though...

we could go 11 cities to safe on out district count, but that gives us less jobs. hosing does not see to be a issue in building an optimal refinery world, finding jobs for all the unemployed does though.

&amp;#x200b;

# with prosperity

we get 2 clerks per city, and a merchant every 50 pops. that means we need to find \[75 pop - 15 strat resource - 30 clerk - 3 admin - 2 enforcer - 1 merchant\] = 24 more jobs for our pops. we will need 75 amenities (assuming no upkeep modifiers), so we have \[75 - 8 from planetary capital - 60 from clerks - 9 from admins - 4 from merchant\] = 6 extra amenities to work with.

&amp;#x200b;

from this quick breakdown, it's looking like you want to sprinkle your strategic resource buildings on your mining and generator worlds to take advantage of the building slots you're not using with all your pops in mining/technician jobs. the thing is, sprinkling these strategic resource buildings around means you are not getting that +5% production bonus for specializing your planet.

&amp;#x200b;

ideally, i'd like to be able to make use of some of the tiny worlds you can find to make them refinery worlds. i'd rather not use a size 22+ world that i'd like to become a forge/industrial/tech-world."
356,because mine looks strange. i can still see the star through gaps in the construction. also i built my sphere around a blue star and now it's red. is this a bug or was it always like this?
357,"this is something that has been on my mind ever since 2.0 was released.

the way system ownership works was drastically changed in 2.0 from the spheres of influence that planets had to direct ownership of every single system. since that change all of the endgame crisis factions have been incredibly underwhelming. this is not only due to changes in the game mechanics but also serious ai issues with the crisis factions.

before 2.0 crisis factions used to be enemies that the galaxy had to band together before they would end up swallowing everything. this is because they were able to expand quickly. this is unfortunately no longer the case.

#**the first issue is that crisis factions expand at a snails pace.**

this is because of 2 reasons:

* 1.) the ai has far too few construction ships for it's job. the unbidden are only given 4 in total for example.

* 2.) the construction ships don't build starbase in any logical order but rather race from one end of their territory to build a starbase on the other end. that works fine at the start of a crisis, but the larger their territory becomes the worse this gets.


a good way to test a crisis factions expansion rate is by looking when they trigger their secondary crisis factions. if the unbidden cover 15% of the galaxy for example, the game will spawn the aberrant and vehement factions. i tested this with multiple runs on a very large galaxy without any other empires to interfere with. this is how long it took for them to conquer 15% (150 systems) of the galaxy:

* 1.) in 1.9 the unbidden need about 10 years

* 2.) in 2.2 the unbidden need about 250 (!!!) years


keep in mind these are numbers that you get when no one attacks them. if anyone actually decides to attack the 2.2 crisis, blow up starbases or attack construction ships then the whole thing falls apart and they will never control enough territory.


#**the second issue is that crisis factions leave most of their military camping around.** 

the vast majority of its fleets are now sitting around in empty systems waiting for construction ships to arrive. the only threat they cause is to your computers cpu when they start to pile up. before 2.0 the crisis would send its fleets to attack targets, constantly. none of the ships would sit around doing nothing. there is absolutely no threat holding of singular fleets that arrive to attack your systems.


unfortunately none of those issues can be adjusted with the crisis strength option you have in the lobby as all that does is buff their fleets but doesn't help make them any smarter.


#**how to solve these issues?**

+ 1.) remove the arbitrary limit on construction ships. why does the crisis need a fixed number of construction ships?

+ 2.) fix the ai for the constructors. the amount of time construction ships waste on travel is incredibly high.

+ 3.) stop fleets from camping around in empty systems. all the crisis needs to do is to escort its construction ships. there is no need for the incredibly high amount of unused fleets. all this does is increase lategame lag without contributing to any relevant conflict/gameplay. i'd rather the crisis had less fleets but used them in a meaningful way."
358,"clerks. trade values +2, amenities +2.

&amp;#x200b;

but they can get very poor boosts, this makes them pretty useless (or maybe undesirable) compared to other workers jobs like miners (minerals+4), technicians (energy+4), farmers (foods+6).

&amp;#x200b;

for trade values, what works:

* stability bonus ((stability - 40) \* 0.6%)
* bonus from tradition (open market, +10%)
* bonus from building (galactic stock exchange, +20%)
* pop trait bonus (thrifty: +20%)

what does not works (not exists):

* sector governor's level bonus (+lv\*2%)
* technology bonuses (+10%\*4 times, +5% repeatable tech)
* bonus for all jobs: tech synthetic thought patterns (+5%)
* bonus for all workers: tradition workplace motivators (+5%), ethic authoritarian (+5% or +10%)
* pop trait bonus which is raising ""worker output"": strong (+2%), very strong (+5%)
* pop trait bonus which is raising ""resource from jobs"": robust (+5%), nerve stapled (+10%)
* gaia world bonus (+10%)

the amenities are worse. they have no bonus buildings, no stability bonuses, no bonus traditions.

&amp;#x200b;

i don't know, maybe i'm just unlucky with every gaia planet i've encountered so far, but i'm missing the real **awe** value from gaia planets, the feeling that they used to give me pre-2.2. a few modifiers, or something else that would make them unique would all help, and i'm almost certain i'm not the only one that feels this way.

*small edit; apparentely they still give a 10% resource production boost according to someone in the comments. this still isn't enough to even take the terraforming to gaia planets ascenion perk in consideration by a long shot, and gaia planets still feel lackluster to all the other special things you can enounter right now. i'm sure there's some way to make them feel as they should. special districts, different modifiers, more planetary features, tons of possibilities.* ***make gaia planets great again!***

360,"title. have your leader be alexander the great in space. make it a civic of some sort. your ruler truly leads from the front and takes matters personally into their grasping appendages in the most dramatic way possible. trade all the empire benefits a ruler would give for greatly increased morale, damage, fire rate etc. 

dumps standard ruler traits for fleet/general traits. during peace time they’re less functional, meaning empire would rely more on governors to keep things running or other means to pick up the slack. 

but, battles they win temporarily boost empire wide happiness/unity or provide influence, the amount dependent on the difficulty of the battle (victory against an evenly matched or stronger opponent yields greater rewards).  defeat/death results in debuffs to these stats instead, unless the leader acquires unique, rare traits that mitigate these effects.

is it determined by the midgame start year? ai aggressiveness slider? is it some fixed period? in 2.2 vasalization is no longer locked behind domination. so the only reason they wouldn't make you a vassal in 2220 must be some sort of leniancy mechanic and i'm wondering how that works."

i formed a migration treaty with the united nations of earth and got a completely different alien population sent my way that was in their ranks. from a few of these early in the game, said alien race took over half my empire in population growth despite not having any population modifiers. the random grow a pop function was choosing this alien population practically every time for grown pops. selecting a specific pop (ie my race) leads to growth penalties.

383,"coming from a wide player in niven. in le guin, i find myself really strained for not playing wide anymore.

first, because by playing wide, the amount we need to pay leaders gets so ridiculously high. 2 for one leader? try 4, and due to being wide, you are paying 20 just for the governors and the science becomes terribly challenging.

in niven, each planet can sustain its own and it is pumping out science so it is much better to just blindly play wide.

in le guin, well... each planet needs 50 years of investment to start sustaining their own, and when you have 20 pops on one planet, you are feeding so much on them and building science buildings are very awkward, as you may be 21-planets wide, you are only producing barely enough consumer goods and food while only running a mineral income of +95 a month, and it takes 6 months to get enough to build a city district.

and a 20-pop planet, what would usually be there? admin, civilian industry, monument/temple, one lab and then? 

a civilian industry produces 12 goods, and each lab uses 4. so basically, one industry, one monument and one lab is just about right, if only on ideal planets. for poor habitability, we are running such a terrible deficit on consumer goods. too many industries, you cut into your purse for the energy upkeep.

i get it that more planets will pump out more pops. but thing is they are a drain on economy and it is almost quite late the game to be feasible to relentlessly colonise everything, as we want our capital to be able to sustain more expansion, instead of constantly draining its growth.

you get the idea. this all leads to an extremely same-y mid game where i've usually filled up my borders next to the assholes, built up star bases so they can't attack me, and look for ways to get my science ships beyond them to explore more of the galaxy and oh look it's jackasses who've closed their borders already.

without engaging diplomacy or heavy need for internal politics and decisions the game dies in the mid game. it has always died in the mid game. unless you are playing as a race that is able to/wants to kick people's butts repeatedly there is nearly nothing to do. i thought the galactic market would introduce some more interesting things but even getting the hub barely does anything. you don't get a super cool station, you can't even see a benefit to your planet. i'm not sure why it was so important one person have the ability to control it aside from having lower fees.

i thought having a major economic overhaul would add a lot to the mid game but it really doesn't. 

so as it stands, empire generation has to create a more balanced and less hostile galaxy in order for us to even be able to use some of these features. at least make it an adjustable option. because i love playing as multi-xeno states and the game, as it stands, makes it very hard to do so unless i get lucky with rngesus."

however, that was not to last, as my federation ai throughout this entire game had been uh... less than perfect.

&amp;#x200b;

they were constantly declaring wars, and i had numerous times gotten the roman empire(the red down south of me) to be willing to join, but they continuously wouldn't let them in besides them being +200 opinion with them.

now, they were continuously trying to declare 2 wars at once, one against the empire to the south of me and east of rome, and one against the techarus multiplex. since i kept getting negative opinion modifiers whenever i stopped the war... and since war was basically unavoidable,  i decided the best solution was to start the wars myself with wargoals that atleast made some sense. mainly, making them my tributaries. thus started the war that nobody wanted, the 1st galactic war. 

&amp;#x200b;

[green is my empire, yellow my client states, purple is my federation, red is the enemy](https://i.redd.it/fojjrv2g3o421.png)

the unfortunate consequence is that the romans, who had always been staunch friends to my federation, and had been given association status and had almost joined, were now fighting alongside our enemies. we're now fighting about a third of the galaxy, while owning about another third... only about a third of the galaxy isnt involed in this war. anybody have any advice on how to win this thing? the war goals is to vassalize as a tributary the techarus multiplex in one war against the techarus, the tycor, and the romans, and in the other war the wargoal is to vassalize as a tributary rax'thalak citizen union against the rax'thalak and the romans"

404,"hey guys im playing a game with a good chunk of friends tonight and i have a few questions ibneed answering before i start.

currently im rocking a race with 

traits: 15% energy credits
           10% society research
            repugnant 

ethics: fanatic xenophobe
             pacisfist 

efficient buracracy
inward perfection

basically my idea is to take as much space as i can and grow and boom as much as i can. i m taking the society research trait because i plan to biologically ascend for the 30% extra growth

my questions are

1. do you think that is a good race to do that with?

2. can you remove inward perfection later in the game, and if not what other one would you reccomend i take?

3. would i be better off dropping the extra energy credits for more growth?

4. what traditions should i take?

my inital plan is to:

· build 6 scientists as quick as possible to scout as much land as possible

· colonize as much as i can

· proceed from there 

i usually take an early alloy foundry in order to do this to gather as much scientists as possible. i eill then focus on buying the 25% growth for every planet i colonize

405,"i've been getting really into stellaris for the past couple weeks, but there's still a lot of things i don't know, and i'm hoping the community here can help a bit as i've gotten myself into an ""interesting"" position.

i unintentionally split a neighbouring civilization in half by taking control of some of their systems, and now i want to just take over the rest of their shit and enslave them, but i am having trouble figuring out how to do it. i apparently have a truce with them for several years from when they surrendered, is there any way i can get around it?

&amp;#x200b;

i didn't understand too well how ""claims"" work, and i still don't really know what ""casus belli"" means (it's like having a reason to attack them? unless there's a truce, i guess?). i claimed a few of their systems in the first war which are now mine, and i've claimed more systems since, but i guess i am going to have to wait until the truce expires, i think - if anyone can confirm that would be helpful. as it is right now, i can see them building up a new fleet (albeit extremely slowly) and i would really like to prevent that if possible for obvious reasons.

406,"so far i've started 3 different runs of wide playthroughs, and they more or less devolve into a delicate balancing (and failure to manage) food, exotic resources, consumer goods and/or alloys.

is there a way to boost population growth to fix that? i've already done everything i can find, from research to clone vats spam to gene clinics spam to food spam for the increased pop growth decision, but nothing is more demoralizing than being almost 100 years in with one of my core resources being barely positive."
407,"i recently did a fanatic materialist/gestalt run and i was sorely disappointed. it seems that they have made it so that there are nothing but downsides with robots now? 

ascension down sides:

-you dont have ruler pop jobs for some reason which means that all your planets take huge amenities and production hits for the most part.

-your organic pops are just are vanilla robots that need to be upgraded. which if you have a large population means that if you dont have insane science you now have terrible pops for 40+ months even longer if you had specialized pops 

-seems like you need to more heavily prep your economy for the change which is inconvenient at best

-you get habitability which is nice but at that point in the game you have settled in to your empire size for the most part and anything that you dont have you can terraform

-the new synthetic perk seems lack luster 5% to all jobs with your ruler and another 5% for minerals and energy for governors and 5% research speed? for all the work that you have to do to prep for a 5-10% boost seems pretty sad. especially compared with the genetic ascension and even worse if you have xeno-compatibility.

-the new planetary management system screws you. before when you were changing your economy over it switched all food buildings over automatically. ok, you have bio-reactors but those both take time to build, takes up a precious building space and just gives a 1:1 food to energy and you cant have a food production trait with robots. with minerals unless you got lucky and got planets with lots of mining/energy districts and/or heavily prioritized putting pops on mining/energy districts you are going to be heavily in debt. so that's even more pops and planning you have to do to make it viable. if you min-max thats also more unspecialized planets and empire size penalties you have to deal with. 
____________________________________________________

disadvantages for gestalt start

-no trade. this is a major detriment to gestalt. you cant get extra unity or energy that all other organics start out with.

- no ruler jobs and the new planetary management system still screws you 

-you need lots of energy and mining districts to support your population. therefore you cant build many nexus (city) districts. therefore you have no housing so you have to fill your building slots with drone storage. cool you now have housing but after 60-70  pops what do you do? for organics you build commerce megaplexes and get that trade value bonus or specialty ruler buildings. for robots i cant build any more science because it takes up too many minerals. same applies to alloys. maybe refineries for trade or edicts but that's situational. 

-robot traits arent very good with the current game. i have to start with power drills or superconductive otherwise its tough to compensate for building and upkeep for robots, science, and hiring pops and using the galactic market. which means i cant get the pop build speed bonus's to keep up with the ai no to mention other players. the negative traits are really negative and make the early game even tougher to keep up.

-robots dont get any growth speed that is integral for your capital and making colonies useful. 

-the war exhaustion and influence doesn't make up for the new major bonuses for ethics.

-your ruler doesnt get any starting traits that can be really powerful for organics

-ascensions are not very good. by the time you get to synthetic age your pops are already specialized so the +2 mod points arent a big deal like the other ascensions are. arcologies nullifies the machine world bonus

-since you cant modify where specific pops go any more the specialization bonus of robots is much more nullified. 

all of these things compound and make it so that you are spending energy and minerals at a insane pace that is to the point of making robots unplayable. the bonuses and play styles that you used to use to balance it all out practically do nothing. i used to like robots but now its like i have a handicap.

backstory:

on the 11th of november in 2106, interfearance of electronics was noticed on earth and it's spacestations. it was later found out to be a transmission from a reptilian looking alien species and their language could not be translated which made communication with them impossible. for a still unknown reason the aliens launched an offense against earth and all of mankind. the aliens destroyed all our stations and satellites in space leaving us on earth. the aliens didn't get an easy victory over earth as it was expected to go, but they got a war of attrition as the human race began a guerilla campaign against the invaders. after 7 long years of conflict, the alien invasion force suddenly began to leave from earth due to unknown reasons. the remaining aliens who still remained and fought consisted of small groups at the most strategically important locations and ironically the invaders who beat us at the beginning of this conflict became the ones getting beaten, and were the ones fighting a guerilla campaign. 

after the last remaining forces fighting were destroyed in the spring 2115 and the remaining aliens were executed, humanity had survived, but the war had taken a massive toll on earth and it's life. several ecosystems destroyed, worldwide famine, society on the brink of total anarchy and a threat of a worldwide technological regression to the dark ages just like after the roman empire. from the ashes a new nation formed from the largest organized group, the terran union which took control of the reconstruction of earth while the barely functioning goverments of the world that remained agreed to give all the power to this military organisation formed during the invasion, which was the most effective at fighting the aliens and now it was the only one able to rebuild earth. it took drastic measures to preserve society consisting from limited acces to resources for the people to a mandatory one child policy. a citizenship system was implemented to control the people, while focus was put on eliminating things like racism and sexism in the favor of advancing mankind. for two decades people lived under bleak conditions, no personal liberty, constant surveillance and extensive rationing of all resources while the situation on earth seemed to not be improving as the task to rebuild was too much for even for the terran union, due to their decentralized nature from the war time.  even with all the propaganda, surveillance and threat of execution, the conditions were bad enough for millions to go on to the streets or gather illegally and protest against the bleak conditions which lead to several bloody clashes that caused thousands of casualties. order was beginning to break down after 21 years of bleak conditions and strict laws and in this chaos an illegal party promised to bring prosperity and stability while the terran union had brought them only rationing and false promises. the resistance against the terran union and high ranking members of the goverment joining the new party made the remaining leadership loyal to the goverment firing hundreads of officials while halting all projects as it tried to restructure it's goverment. when the restructuring was going nowhere, the people and the high ranking officials had had enough. the military, people from all across earth and high ranking officials from the goverment fought their way through the little remaining defensive forces in the tower 1, one of the many administrative buildings from which the terran union was governed from. the terran loyalist forces held out in several bunkers, public buildings, prisons and the tower 1 for several days, until they ran out of men and resources due to being surrounded. the fighting ended when tower 1 fell and the leaders of the terran union were executed in a planetwide public broadcast and soon after the remaining forces where overwhelmed and executed on spot.

the new goverment changed their name to the interstellar human empire. they centralized many of the govermental functions to go through the supreme leader rost nora and under his rule was formed the central council consisting of the highest ranking governors, scientists, admirals and generals etc and several policies and laws were kept from the terran union's time out of necessity. this new goverment was very efficient and already in the summer of 2137 production of resources was enough to lighten or lift rationing on several resources and the efforts of cleaning the environment had shown major progress. soon followed the boom of construction and technological innovation unlike anything ever seen before and there was built a new city over the ruins of dhaka, bangladesh as the new administrative center for the goverment of the interstellar human empire. most of the policies and laws from the terran union's time were removed or changed as they were no longer necessary. the production of material for rebuilding earth's cities, infrastructure and the construction of a spacestation orbiting the sun took decades, but on the 5th of november 2167 earth was again ready for space and we begun to finally research the ruined ships in the orbit of earth which revealed us many advanced technologies allowing us to finally head for the skies. the reconstruction effort required a lot of resources, which lead us to establishing mining and research stations in the solar system, which sparked a new age of progress and soon the first fleet of space warfare branch spaceships were built and we were ready to fight in the new frontier of war. now in 2200 our ships are ready to explore the galaxy and find the attackers and they shall see no mercy from us, until all the blood spilled by the aliens has been paid tenfold."

415,"i have another race enslaved and pretty much set my empire out to rely on slaves as working class. i have slave processing facilities and precinct houses on every world to keep in them in line. however stability is worsening throughout my empire due to low approval. my own race is full on approval though, every faction except for a minority one is 75-90%.

my best guess is that the low stability is caused by the slaves. however, there is no indicator for them anywhere? i would like to test and purge them on one planet to see if that helps - but that's also not possible anymore? the only way to purge i've seen is empire-wide from the 'species' overview.

mostly, i feel that it is very hard to actually influence vassals despite a few lines describing them as the least independent subject. 

why is it impossible to change their ethics or so on? ask for certain systems, stop their military from actually participating in wars if they can't win and so on. or being able to get rid of certain populations by sending them to ~~australia~~ the vassal. 
and why not be able to set taxes in exchange for resentment? obtain a monetary gain but you risk to enter war with said vassal. higher taxes being possible but also coming at the cost of increasingly high resentment which could be counter balanced with certain benefits for the vassals."

""does 'detached observer' mean anything at all to you? anything at all? you're the most brilliant sociologist i've ever seen, you could be my boss's boss by now, but you keep sabotaging yourself like this. this is supposed to be a disciplinary assignment, because of the virus incident, and you keep making things worse for yourself. care to at least explain that one? you never did.""

""what's there to explain? it was a seed of hope, among all that was lost.""

""hope for whom, exactly? the iktari are gone! by the time the coalition fleets got back from vetirius to face the machine rebellion, it was too late for the iktari worlds. then you go rogue and release the uplift retrovirus on the rubble, instead of helping us hunt down the xt seedships! we destroyed all 488 of the damned things while you were 'giving hope' to whom exactly? the vermin in the trash piles?""

""anyway, i've contacted you to tell you to pack. you're getting another disciplinary transfer. after the tragic cybrex attacks on the refugee ringworlds of the mechazur continuance, the coalition has decided to start a replacement project. adanis ii is being terraformed to a gaia world, as a means to house a diverse group of sentients in ideal conditions. it's called ""the preserve project"", and you're going to work there.""

""look jolas, it's not up to you to save the galaxy. you aren't alone. i hear there's even talk of a radical approach to the cybrex crisis. word is that maybe, if we can't beat them, we can hack them, get them to value organics. and i know ascension theory predicts that a new dark age is coming, but we're fighting it tooth and claw. that's what the foundation of the preserve, and the curator order is! the adnorans are doing their own thing, they dedicated an entire planet to preserving the galaxy's knowledge in an archive, and there are talks of a joint cultural venture, with dedicated, self-sufficient stations at three locations in the galaxy. that's what seeds of hope look like, not you ignoring rules to get to feel like a hero!""

""we've been friends a long time, but you keep making it harder and harder. please, please, settle down. stop making things worse, by trying to make them better. if you need extra convincing, consider this as me calling in the favor you owe me for not reporting the modified com system you smuggled to the people on the gas giant.""

anyways the biggest changes with synth ascension, is that capital buildings give assembler jobs, and you're not allow to outlaw ai.

&amp;#x200b;

so after 2.2 i noticed stellaris runs really slowly in 2.2. the begging is usually lag-free but by 2350 it becomes almost unplayable. i've noticed this is a bit of a problem going around many users and wanted to ask if anyone knew any way to solve it. my specs meet the recommended stellaris ones and i've upgraded to the latest drivers, so i'm not sure why this is happening. anyone know if the devs plan on releasing a fix?

456,"so my fleet of 38 ships, destroyers and corvettes, is still taking nearly 3000 alloys and stupidly long to upgrade. the upgrades are fairly substantial, all weapons and armour being upgraded one or 2 tiers, but 3000 alloys? that seems far to much. "
457,"not at my phone right now, so i don't know the planet trait name. if you choose the one that makes your homeworld a size 25 gaia, and the nearby habitable planets option in the galaxy creation settings is set to 2, you will only get one nearby gaia world.

in my current game as a devouring swarm i took that trait as an experiment. my 2nd gaia was 2 jumps out, but i had zero other habitable planets within 10 jumps.


also, story time! 

started on the north side, inside edge of a large ring shaped galaxy. playing on commodore difficulty with scaling difficulty enabled, i wasn't able to take on any of the two nearby empires until about the year 2350 because of alloys. 

to my southwest i was blocked by about 20k worth of crystalline entitities, northwest about 1600, and i had a marauder empire about 5 jumps out to my north. there was a single chain of hyperlanes going around them that led to my third habitable planet (a continental with 60% habitability), and the next jump was a standard machine empire. there were no other exits to the cluster i was in, so i got stuck with about 12 systems total versus the machine empire's 50+ and 8 planets.

on top of all of this, i didn't get the damn card for mote extraction until about the year 2280, with only a single size one motes node, and synthetic chem plants didn't pop up until about 2330. already had the tech for nano forges at that point, which came in handy later. 

i rushed food and pop growth buildings, built 5 standard alloy forges on all 3 of my planets, and slowly, painfully built up ships until i could clear the 1600 ish worth of crystalline entities, while getting constantly raided by the marauder empire. the chain of hyperlanes i unlocked from killing those crystalline entities led northwest, then north, then east, right back to the same machine empire, and the last system also connected to an authoritarian empire further west. about 20 systems, all filled with energy and minerals, but nothing useful. no planets.

within 6 months of building a starbase in that last system, the machine empire declared war. i had about 2500 fleet at this point, and he rolled in with over 4500. i had to sit in my home system and just watch as he rolled over everything i had painstakenly taken, while desperately selling everything i had on my internal market to get alloys for more ships. after he took over that one planet to my north, on his southern border, i finally had enough to counterattack. wiped his fleet, took back my planet, and started advancing on his territory toward his closest planet. finally managed to bust through his star fortress, kill the rest of his fleet, and took over his planet. i had about 2500 fleet left at this point.

then a neutral marauder fleet, already on its way to that same planet, arrived in system. it was about 9k fleet power. as soon as it touched the planet, it flipped hostile, wiped my fleet and my troop transports, and took a shit load of my already precious resources. it then proceeded to ignore the machine empire's pathetic 500 points of fleet, which somehow flipped the star fortress before it finished rebuilding, and his power 32 transport fleet took back the planet, which had zero defense armies because of the marauders.

ironman mode, of course. i promptly rage quit for the day.

skip to now. as soon as i unlocked it, i swapped all of my pop growth buildings to chem plants, all of my agriculture districts to mining and generator, and upgraded my 15 alloy forges to mega and then nano forges. i zeroed out on food in a couple months. within about 5 years i went from the previous zero fleet to almost 40k of fleet, and promptly annihilated the machine empire. i now have living space, dedicated agriculture planets, and i just finished genetic resequencing, added the housing reduction trait and rabbits super-trait (forget what it's called, 30% pop growth bonus), and my pop growth rate is at +9 something per month on every planet. 

the year is 2366, and my devouring swarm can finally try to go after an organic empire. just not those fucking marauders with their couple hundred thousand points of fleet, grumble grumble. "
458,"am i doing something wrong, or is this a bug?"

460,"shared burden i find to be pretty cool, finally being able to play and make a true worker's utopia. however i feel it has many flaws

**technocracy compatibility-** i find it strange that out of all the civics that you could take with shared burden, technocracy was the only one you can't do. its strange because most technocratic movements were also socialistic and many famous scientists in history like albert einstein were socialist wanting something like shared burden.

**megacorp-** i didn't investigate thoroughly but it seems like megacorps can establish branch offices in a truly equal society which doesn't really make sense (there could have a super bad opinion modifier that i don't know about that prevents this but there should be a restriction just in case, especially with how in multiplayer opinion modifiers don't matter)

**merchant/mining guilds-** i find it strange how you could have an equal society and super powerful and influential merchant/mining guilds. i feel you shouldn't be able to have both

**communist icon-** doesn't really have to do with the civic but in the human emblem section i wish we would get a better hammer and sickle. the one in the game looks pretty dumb with how the wrench is twisted to look like a sickle and a drill is the hammer (the drill kinda works but the very mechanical look of the sickle with the wrench ends just looks dumb)"
461,"i remember coming across a post claiming the ai heavily cheated on tech to keep up with the player but that was pre-2.2. just how much does the ai cheat in 2.2?

464,"asking for a friend.

but seriously, i'm a bit lost with it to be honest."
465,"a few ideas i'm kicking around as i explore 2.2. not sure how correct any of them are; appreciate discussion and correction

1 all hail keynes. the more valuable energy (ie the cheaper everything else is) is in the long run the worse off you'll be. because a super strong energy price means you effectively can't sell whatever surpluses you have. i learned this the hard way when i sold so much stuff to finance a distant war the galaxy wide market froze and *everyone went bankrupt*. so basically you want money to be cheap. have some standing orders for minerals and food. you're basically stimulating the galactic economy, including your own, by spending. the extra resources are nice too

1a unless you're a mega corp. then your size cap means your entire life blood will be energy from trade. that means you want the currency as strong as possible to maximize your power and reduce everyone else's. (not coincidentally a certain class of irl bond trader is always obsessed over inflation). so you sell the shit out of everything you can. you're aiming to be so rich you can buy your way out of any fight and also economically cripple your rivals (and also allies but hey, capitalism)

2 all else being equal you will generally be more efficient at producing things than the market, ie producing your own consumer goods/rare elements will be more cost effective in the long term. for my own organization i'm specializing planets in production- one for alloys, one for consumer goods and so forth. so once you're running a moderate trade deficit for a resource start building up to produce it. i'm trying to buy minerals, which are cheap, and produce alloys and consumer goods, which are expensive.

3 it doesn't matter if, say, you're building alloy plants on a farm planet. but it does matter how many people will be building stuff and therefore needing housing. for that reason low job industries (research, rare element synthesis) should go on small planets. you're not getting many districts out of that anyway so just make city districts for housing and stack labs/etc. vice versa also applies: you want extra building space for housing for alloy and consumer plants. 

4 i still am not sure whether arcologies are worth it? i get that they are super producers of trade and unity but i've already been three traditions deep when the option became available. maybe if it comes up super early. and also a super mine planet should have it since arcologies can't produce energy anyway. but that might mean rearranging the trade routes which could be a pain in the ass

5 i feel like it's good to keep a solid production line of consumer goods, selling them depresses the price so when you grab a bunch more planets it won't be that painful to buy them for a while. 

edit add: so vassals seem like a much better part of the game now as opposed to pre 2.2. federations too; their pains aside as multi party defensive pacts theyre surviving much more/longer in the starts i've tried. vassals can only be released in peace time though, so one needs a long term plan before late mid/late game when everyone tends to be at war all the time. but also the domination traditions have been made useful for non overlords/kind of useless to having vassals per se. not sure what to think of it"
466,"i know paradox has only so much time in the day, but i would personally love a mod that expands the government type beyond just a governing ethic and a unique type of housing.  megacorps meanwhile play the game vastly different than other types by being encouraged to play tall.

how would y’all make the communist gov type more unique?  personally one way i would like to see implemented is dividing up the degrees of socialism so it isn’t always pure commie or free market.  would make the existing markets more interesting by juggling different economic types with energy still being the backing currency."
467,"disclaimer: i am a casual player, and am no means good at the game. which is why i was so surprised when i found it easy to take over everyone.

&amp;#x200b;

after easily stomping every single empire i found in my game as a devouring swarm, i tagged to some of the other remaining empires to see what was up - why was the ai so bad?

&amp;#x200b;

it became abundantly clear. it isn't the ai being particularly bad at handling the new system - they have plenty of resources and production. the problem is, they do not build forges. like, at all. easy mode at 2343, the greatest production of alloys was +30. and it wasn't that they were losing a bunch either. the highest total production (ignoring costs) was 36 alloys, 27 of which were from jobs. this is horrendous. 

to restate: their other production was fine for an ai. 500 energy, 216 minerals, 173 minerals, and 12 consumer goods (producing 390, with upkeep costs).

this seems like the devs did not sufficiently weigh the production of alloys. this stunts the ai's fleet power and expansion massively."
468,"first of all, i'm quite a paradox player. i've got 1400 hours in vicky 2, 900 in hoi4, 800 in eu4 and 700 in ck2.

  so far, i absolutely love this game like i love all other paradox games, and i don't even have any major dlcs yet. after watching a little bit of some let's plays on youtube i got started as space britain to bring civilization to xeno savages. i made the galaxy huge, and i kind of regret it now because i set the number of ai empires to around ten. i got first contact in around 2255 or so.

  anyway, i started cautiously and familiarized myself with the control scheme. it's still a little bit ankward due to the 3d elements, but nothing serious. the game itself feels like a mix of victoria 2 (my favorite pdx game), eu4 and a little bit of hoi4 and ckii. i particularly like how resources and pops are managed and how they work together. i learned many thing is the fly, such as the fact that pops aren't midless slaves and actually want amenities, or that building whatever whereever isn't a brilliant long-term economic plan. i've struggled with balancing my resource production balance quite a bit, which i like. i've also gotten my ass kicked by a bunch of ancient mining drones despite attacking with a superior force, which i don't like. i have quite a few opinions i would like to share right now.

- some notification noices are scary. having a leader die the first time was quite a jump scare, as was being alerted of hallucinogens on one of my colonies.

- when i first dismissed an alert i though that someone moved a chair upstairs.

- marauders are really strong. i've played for more than a century now and a bunch of them that i found early on still occupy an odd enclave inside my empire that i still can't get rid of.

- having a fallen empire hate you forever because you didn't know that a wormhole lead to their territory is stupid.

- it's tough, even as a xenophobe, to balance between influence points and personal emotions. i don't want to abandon those sweet friendly space bugs for the sake of expanding my empire.

- i love the early game flavor. it felt good finding all the cybrex artifacts and locating their former homeworld, a massive ruined ring. it left quite and impression on me. i loved reading the story about an ancient machine empire 600,000 years ago. bit by bit i discovered who they were, that they did and what happened to them.

- it made no sense for my white briton queen to randomly give birth to an asian. having an asian queen of the uk is pretty immersion-breaking.

- i just love some of the insults alien empires can give. apparently english speech sound like an alien animal taking a dump.

- why do humans have only 20% habitability on savanna worlds, given that they basically originated from the savanna?

- the great wound is nsfl for tropophobes.

- should i use kinetic weapons, lasers, or a mix of some sort?

- how can i civilize pre-sapient pops?

- clearing blockers feel so good, partially due to the sound it makes. i've so far completely destroyed the biospheres of more than a dozen planets.

- helping sentient clouds and underground civilizations feels good, even as a xenophobe. britons are there to spread civiliation, after all.

- could somebody inform those xenos that i, too, have heard the good news, but mine are much bigger and actually work? i hope those poor evangelizing zealots realize that i'm the head of the church of england so i'm not even legally allowed to convert.

- stellaris has perhaps taken a bit (and by that i mean a crap ton) too many liberties when it comes to plausability, but it's a game after all, so i don't mind.

- does the galaxy have cycles of some sort? does a generation of civilizations rise, prosper and fall, and after that there's no civilizations for thousands of years until a new generation arises? it seems like the galaxy is full of ancient alien artifacts, but the galaxy starts out empty.

- i like to believe that fallen empires secretly take bets among eachother on which civilizations will prosper and which will fall.

that's about it."
469,"sup guys. i've been thinking about this type of bombardment for quite a long time now. the title speaks for itself: hurl an asteroid into matching orbit to the bombarded planet. this would be the true armagedon bombardment.

here is some detail i have in mind: there would be a mid-game research which would enable an empire to use the asteroid bombardment policy. once you researched it, you'd need to assign a scientific ship to search the system for a ""hurlable"" asteroid inside a system. this should be a medium difficulty task (iv-vi). once you are done, you get a special project to assign a construction ship to adjust the orbit of the asteroid, this would take around 50 days to complete. once this is done, both the defending and attacking empire would get a notification about the date of the impact, which would come in 100 days, during which defending forces would be able to ""kill"" the asteroid. so it would take a lot of haste and around a year to finally collide with the planet.

but here is why: upon impact, one of two things could happen: 

50% chance to devastate the planet to 100%

or

50% chance killing everyone on the planet. im not sure whether it should be turned into a tomb world.

using this type of bombardment would result in a -100 opinion, just like purging.

what are your thoughts about this? i'd love to hear them.

472,"i love the idea of spamming strike craft, and i *really* love the way they look, but they seem pretty... underwhelming. their damage is fine, the problem is that you can only deploy them in very small numbers. it feels like they're always paired with picket weapons, which to me seems to defeat their purpose--you can't effectively pair strike craft with artillery to keep your battleships safe.

i feel like they have the potential to be great late game weapons because of their 10% damage scaling vs the regular 5% you get on energy/kinetic weapons, but they're so hamstrung by the fact that you can't make a viable fleet built around them that i don't really see how the should be used.

it seems like you could build a starbase around them since you can go pure strike craft for defense platforms, but why bother limiting your fleet to have fancy defense platform? does anyone know how to make these things work?"
473,basically the title. right now i’m clicking system to system all over the map to check on see if i can open branch offices on my neighbours who i have a commercial pack with. is there an easier way to do this than by clicking on each system and then the planet? if there isn’t then can one be added?
474,"i'm not very good at these games despite enjoying them so much - how do you deal with this? i'm in end game and every planet is constantly complaining about this. what am i supposed to do? all districts are built. all buildings are built. as far as i understand it, i have literally no action i can take. "
475,"with the 'new' (getting a bit old now) update, starbases defensive modules finally have a real purpose. namely, guarding trade.

however, i did notice something that seems unbalanced. hangars, missiles and guns all cost the same alloys and the same time, yet one seems to be the best choice in all cases once unlocked due to better trade protection. 

so is there a reason to stick with guns/missiles that i missed or are hangars just plainly better? if they are, maybe they should receive a buff."

477,"basically with watching again templin institute's prologue video for the greater terran union and creating a story for my own human empire i thought about an idea.

simply it's that if you fail to invade a primitive world, it will have effects on the civilization and here are some quick ideas of mine:

a failed invasion in general will cause the empire to become a fanatic xenophobe 

pre steam age failed invasion would generally not do much

steam to early space age failed invasion would have a 50% chance of putting them back to a random earlier era or boost their development to a normal empire"
478,"0. they have the same number of building slots as normal planets, but there's restrictions on the buildings they can build.

1. they have the same pop growth as normal planets, but they don't seem to have the 50% penalty for a new colony.

2. they can't be resettled from or to as far as i can see, but they can emigration push so you can set them up to be breeding colonies. if you have migration treaties though you could be breeding people for other empires though.

3. they can't build commercial zones. you need to get clerk jobs from the district.

4. they can't build luxury housing. you need to get housing from the district.

5. they can build hydroponic farms, but they can not build food processing facilities.

6. their central building upgrades instantly (is that a bug?)"

482,"tl:dr: scourge invades, get kicked in the ass by an ancient machine empire and has no planet in its space it could use to procreate.

just ""finished"" my first playthrough.

in 2460, the prethoryn scourge befell the galaxy.

just beneath my borders. i was panicking because my fleets were ill-equipped against them, and my fleet power of around 20-30k was pathetic against their fleets with 48k fleet power each.

but funnily, there was one of these ancient machine civilizations just south of me, also bordering the now scourge-occupied space.

the machines eradicated the scourge fleets, leaving but 1 fleet behind.

i rushed my fleet upgrades/retrofitting to an anti-scourge template, build a second smaller ""extermiation"" fleet to bomb the only ""habitable"" planet in the entire scourge space...

defeated the fleet with some casualties. went on to blow up the remaining scourge 12k starbases, slowly pulling my exterminators to the front. when i reached the system with the planet... it was empty. no scourge to be seen.

they had invaded the galaxy on a spot completely lacking any colonized worlds, the only ""habitable"" planet being a barren world.

485,"paradox is fortunate to have a very active community that helps by reporting and investigating bugs themselves. often times, players don't just report bugs, but the solution as well. a huge problem with this however is that there appears to be no proper bug tracker. yes, there are the forums where you can submit bugs, but keeping track of which bugs are being investigated or detecting duplicates doesn't work well.

thus, i suggest that paradox create a proper bug tracker or at least expands the forum such that working on bugs becomes more transparent. i strongly believe that this would not only help by providing transparency to the community, but it would also increase the benefit of having bug reports in the first place.

a bug tracker should have the following features:

\- required fields: version/branch, localization, mods (can be automatically detected when submitting bugs from within the game)  
\- show status of bug reports: something like ""open"", ""being investigated"", ""could not reproduce"", ""fixed"", ""duplicate""  
\- mark duplicates: a moderator would be required to check new reports and close them if they are duplicates.

490,"i love stellaris, but am i the only one who finds the space battle underwhelming... basically to fleet clash together and  once the battle starts the only thing you control is when you want to retreat. this expansion's goal would be to spice things up on this part of the game.

&amp;#x200b;

\*\*+new ""power priority"" mechanic\*\*

you can now assign your excess power to boost specific stats of your ship:

\-adding a slider under stats like speed, dmg, shield hp, etc to control how much excess power you want to assign to   
these stats 

\-every stats has a ""excess power cap"" that can be increase with additional components (e.g. having more shield   
components equipped increase how much excess power you can allocate to boost said stat).

&amp;#x200b;

\### this way, instead of being almost useless, excess power can help you customize your fleet by making faster,   
stronger or tankier ship.

&amp;#x200b;

\*\*+option to customize worker and science ship design\*\*

\-add the utility module (see below) to utility ship.

&amp;#x200b;

\*\*+new components and modules\*\*

\-utility module: add more auxiliary slots to your ship (allowing you to add more auxiliary components and one special   
auxiliary)

\-power drain: (weapon slot) drain the power of the targeted ship. multiple power drain on the same ship stacks. if   
enough power is drained the target will experience a power shortage for a small amount of time (unable to move or   
attack). you can choose your target in the new combat interface.

\-kamikaze autopilot: (s auxiliary) ships with this component equipped will crash themselves on an enemy target when   
reaching x% of health. bigger ship = more dmg. chance of missing based on the enemy ship evasion stats. you can   
use the new combat interface to choose a specific target.

\-auto-destruction button: (s auxiliary) add the option the auto-destroy your ship and cause dmg to random ships   
(friendly or enemy) in the battle. must be manually activated through the new combat interface.

\-active camouflage: (s auxiliary) can only be equipped on corvette. cannot be use in combat. allow the ship to enter   
the border of another empire without being notice (works on closed border). increase piracy risk if stationned on   
another empire trade route.

\-advance radar: (auxiliary and a space station module) reveal ships using active camouflage.

\-system scanner: (auxiliary for utility ship)  survey system faster. more than one can be built one the same ship.   
allowing you to make a science ship specialized in system survey.

&amp;#x200b;

\### this is a short list of ideas i had in mind, i'm sure you guys can add more to the list. i didn't include all the utility   
ship components but you get the idea (faster survey speed, anomaly research speed, space station build speed, mega   
structure build speed etc..)

&amp;#x200b;

\*\*+transport ship can now enter a space battle and board an enemy ship\*\*

\-transport ship will still be waiting outside the battle zone during a space battle but you now have the option bring   
them in combat. when doing so, they are vulnerable to the enemy fleet (and can be targeted in the new combat   
interface), but they will have the option to board an enemy ship (cruiser and bigger) who has no shield and no armor   
hp left. while boarding, your fleet will cease to fire on the targeted ship. if the boarding is successful you will gain   
control of the enemy ship.

&amp;#x200b;

\*\*+new space combat interface\*\*

\-during a space battle you can select ships to target another specific enemy ship or group of ships (allow you to focus   
fire a titan or drill through the shield of a ship you want to hijack for example).

\-adds the special auxiliary action button when selecting one of your ship to allow you to manually order special   
actions (kamikaze, auto-destruction, ship boarding, etc...)

\-you can control+select multiple ships to do the same action on the same target (you can also control+select enemy   
ships to target a group).

&amp;#x200b;

so this was my idea for a new expansion. obviously there would be more stuff and i didn't consider how balance everything would be but you get my point. feel free to add your own ideas, modify mine or simply describe what you would like to see one day.

500,"so one thing i've noticed since starting 2.2 is the emigration penalties you suffer on your home world when you colonize another planet. and if you dare to colonize two different planets, your growth rate is effectively 0. what causes this and how can this be combated?"

so it turned out, pdx have ~~15b marcet cap.~~ edit: in dollars its 1.7b [proof.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/pdx.st/key-statistics?p=pdx.st)

for example a small niche company like cd projekt red have market cap of a measly 3 billion, while such a great supercorporation like an electronics company has 24 billion.

&amp;#x200b;

also pdx have  29m dollars after tax profit in 2017. [proof.](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/paradoxinteractive-paradox-interactive-ab-publ-publishes-annual-report-for-2017-180418.pdf)

&gt;subsidiaries can now have branch offices and open branch offices in their overlord's territory. commercial pact trading is also done automatically just as when in a federation when you're a subsidiary

as only megacorps can have subsidiaries i'm assuming that the intended state of things is that you (as a megacorp releasing a megacorp subsidiary) should be able to open branch offices in your subsidiaries planets as well as have branch offices opened in your planets. currently it's not possible to do as a megacorp overlord after releasing a sector due to your subsidiary having megacorp authority. it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to make it so that you can only have branch offices in non-megacorp subsidiaries, so presumably this is a bug. the same seems to be true vv since my subsidiaries never opened any branch offices in my colonies.

compared to the regular trade policy that converts 1 trade value = 1 energy credit, the one that does 1 trade value = 0.5 energy credit and 0.25 consumer goods appears to be better mid - late game when you have a significant amount of trade value (and have market access).

because:4 trade value = 2 energy credit, 1 consumer goods.or in other words, 2 energy credit for each unit of consumer goods.and assuming market sell price for consumer goods  is  &gt; 2, you'd potentially get more energy credits this way compared to just converting all trade value to energy credits.

518,"as title says,

been playing stellaris for a while now since 2.2 was released and may have stumbled across a bug?

i understand in order to set your sectors to build you must give them a focus in the sector management screen. the sector then builds off of demands for unemployment and the set focus so the sector is automated. however, gestalts do not have an issue with unemployment so the sector never actually builds anything. 

i have left a sector of 3 planets barren with focus set to balanced for roughly 3 centuries and nothing was ever built, but i have 20+ scavenger drones and 0 unemployment. scavenger drones can become deviants and lower your stability and cause a lot of problems end game so it's tough to micro especially when hiveminds play so well this update. 

across several games i have replicated this so i was wondering if anyone has this problem as well or if i'm just missing something.

525,"right now, as it stands, the ai rebellion can happen at seeminly random moments, without clear indicators and it the fact that it can trigger even when you thought it was impossible just baffles me. now, hear me out, this is not a rant by any means, but the way the ai rebellion is implemented right now is ridiculous in my opinion.

&amp;#x200b;

let me illustrate this with two examples (if you're not interested in reading examples and just want my points i suggest you skip ahead); 

the first example is an experience of my own. i am a pacifist/fanatic xenophile megacorporation around the year 2350. i've researched up until droids and have ignored synthetics up until now. **i own 0 machine pops in the entirety of my empire, no droids, no robots, no synthetics**. i get a few events prior to the ai rebellion that faintly remind me of belonging to the ai rebellion, but i give them no heed. why not? well, i don't own any machine pops, why should i care at all? skip ahead a few years, and suddenly *boom;* ai rebellion, my tiny tech-focused empire split, i have a non-existant fleet considering i was friendly with my neighbours, and i'm on iron man mode so it's all ruined. am i seriously to accept that out of nothing there are suddenly over 100 machine pops that materialized out of thin air!? why are they even mad if they aren't sentient? regardless of the fact that i didn't own any machine pops, even if i did, they weren't sentient, so they shouldn't even be able to address their potential issue of servitude. i only later realized that apparentely i could've prevented all this from happening if i had changed the ai policy to citizen rights so that my non-existant machine pops would be happy. this does not make sense at all, and it ruined the game i was playing. 

example two is of similar breed, so i'll make this one quite short. i'm playing a game with a bunch of friends and one of my friends is in a similar position. he has researched up until droids, and is a materialist/xenophile/militarist. out of the 400 pops in his empire, less than 15 are machine pops. he suddenly gets the ai rebellion, and these 15 machine pops suddenly create an empire that has a combined fleet power almost equivalent to my friends'. why does this happen? how can these few pops even rebel when it's literally such a tiny, tiny percentage of his empire. again, this makes little to no sense, and it makes for a very annoying experience, if not outright ruining your game.

&amp;#x200b;

***my propositions are as follows;***

&amp;#x200b;

**- the ai rebellion can not happen if you don't own any machine pops.**

seriously, this should be obvious.

&amp;#x200b;

**- the ai rebellion can not happen if you did not research synthetics.** 

the ai rebellion only makes sense when you look at it from the perspective of synthetics. now, being sentient, they start to realize they're being exploited and feel as if they deserve to be treated equally to normal citizens, since they work just as hard, if not harder. droids and robots shouldn't even be capable of thinking about rebelling, let alone any exercising any emotional thought at all.

&amp;#x200b;

**- the ai rebellion should only happen if a certain % of your population/planet population is synthetic.**

if less than 20% of your pops are synthetic, they should not have the ability to rebel so easily, it doesn't make any sense. the only exception to this is if there was a planet where the majority of the pops are synthetic, even if your empire in general is overly biological, in which case it makes sense for this planet to rebel.

&amp;#x200b;

**- the pre-ai rebellion events should not occur if you do not own any sentient machine pops.**

this should also speak for itself. machine that can not think should not cause any issues. that's the whole reason ""synthetics"" is a dangerous technology, you're creating potential hostiles.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm sure there are people who feel as if you can ""just predict the ai rebellion from the events and change the policy"", but it just completely breaks immersion that i should even have to think about changing a policy or getting these events when i don't own any machine pops. in general this experience feels as if it could be implemented a lot better, and make way more sense.

527,"in the beta branch trade can't be collected via gateways for performance reasons. idk about wormholes either. this really messes with wide empires that want to expand through wormholes or use a gateway network to eliminate piracy. the idea that trade value isnt worth jack shit unless it goes straight to the capital is kind of flawed to me. new york city for instance is not the capital of the u.s. but is responsible for a massive amount of ""trade value"", a lot of which doesnt have to be shipped anywhere because it deals with nonmaterial goods. i dont see why another planet can't function the same way as a homeworld and serve as a trade hub located in a more convenient location than your capital which you may want to keep as your homeworld for rp reasons or move to your first ecumenopolis. 

of course it should cost a shitload of influence making it only suitable for when you've stopped expanding. this is really just an anti-frustration feature honestly. the cost could scale with admin cap and be something that you think for a long time about as it would have to be defensible and intelligently placed to avoid losing it and screwing up all your trade routes."

534,"so to test out the new update (and the dlc i bought like the nerve stapled slave i am) i started an iron man game with the commonwealth of man. and it's been going well. it's almost like the ai got dumber, or i've been very lucky, because all the regular ai empires are pathetic. most of them quite literally.

in short, the xenophile fallen empire woke up as soon as the game hit 2400, and i'm the only one who could even hope to put up a fight. i can't, though. so the moment they ask, i'm probably going to become a signatory and try to silently build up my fleet and tech while they become decadent. *however*, i have dutifully nerve stapled almost every alien pop in my empire. numbers for most aliens are pretty low, but there's one group that's got a decent number of pops because i conquered three of their core worlds (i had only two honest wars because i still haven't run out of space to expand into, it's been a weird game).

the problem is, nerve stapled pops can't be free. so how is this ae going to react to that? are they just going to shrug at it, demand i technically outlaw slavery, and leave me alone? or are they only going to be happy if i roll back the nerve stapling on every single pop?

and the real question is: should i start purging now?"

536,"okay, i know this is a suggestion that has nearly been done to death, but with the release of 2.2 and its array of new mechanics and resources, i feel like this is a topic that's worth bearing discussion again.  
the game could definitely benefit from new purge types, as well as a few that aren't limited only to xenophobes (because only being able to create refugee crises as an authoritarian feels a bit lackluster).  
of course, many of my suggestions probably wouldn't make it into the game because the devs are too busy with hotfixing 2.2 to worry about flavor additions, but these ideas could be modded in. i'd be willing to at least try to mod them in, if someone can point me in the direction of any resources regarding *how* to mod stellaris. note that i said ""try"", because i would probably mess it up. but i am willing to give it an attempt.  
with that unnecessarily long preface out of the way, here are a couple of my ideas:  
   
  
  

* sapient sacrifice: available to xenophobic spiritualists. purged pops produce +10% unity for priest jobs and possibly amenities.  
  
* reconstitution: available to xenophobic materialists, possibly unlocked by bio ascension. purged pops provide +15% growth for your non-undesirables-class pops. the idea here is that the biological material of purged pops is used as a substrate for your own species' propagation.  
  
* dissident suppression: available to authoritarians. pops are purged very slowly but provide a +5% boon to stability as well as a -10% reduction to crime. a -10% to ethics shift would make sense  too, but that might make this one too overpowered. this is, pretty clearly, a political purge akin to stalin or hitler.  
  
* industrial auxiliaries: available to fanatic authoritarians with a stratified economy and xenophobes. purged pops give your metallurgists and miners a +10% boon to production (similar to how science directors give a research bonus to existing researchers). the purged pops in this scenario are given extremely dangerous industrial jobs that are essentially death sentences. but hey, *someone* has to clean the inside of the alloy furnaces.
  
* cultural annihilation: available to fanatic xenophobes. purged pops yield +10% unity for enforcer jobs as well as +5% happiness for xenophobe pops. purged pops are hunted down and executed with a twisted glee, and their total and utter reduction into nothingness is not dissimilar to the sack and salting of carthage. for lack of a better word, they're erased from the pages of history.  
  
   
edit: s'more ideas! i wanted to expand on the possibilities for this with almost every ethics type, so the use of purges isn't limited to an extremely narrow playstyle. as u/thehavollhive pointed out, however, that may be difficult as purges are hardcoded. but the modding community is pretty creative, so hopefully there can be a workaround. anyway, here's a couple more.  
  
  
* incentivized departure: available for xenophobic pacifists. purged pops are ""displaced"" at a cost of -5% trade value and -5% energy per month until the affected pops are displaced. in this ""purge"" type, undesired xenos are given substantial payouts to exit your empire and hopefully go bother someone else. as the exodus would occupy a not-insignificant portion of your civilian fleets, trade value is lowered in addition to the payout.  
  
* extraordinary rendition: available to egalitarians, possibly just democratic crusaders. pops are very slowly purged and produce +5% stability as well as +5% unity for enforcer jobs. in this purge type, a shadow war is waged on the enemies of your state, and xenos regularly disappear into black sites for enhanced interrogation. the rest of your populace is too busy with their innumerable consumer goods to care about the world around them and the very undemocratic actions of their democratic government.  
  
* pathogenic dispersal: available to materialists. purged pops grant +5% society research for researcher jobs. in this purge type, a pathogenic disease gene-tailored for a specific species is covertly unleashed on the population. due to the secret nature of this type of purge and its plausible deniability, there is no opinion malus.  
  
  

any further ideas or constructive criticisms of my own suggestions are welcome. i hope you enjoyed reading that, because i felt dirty writing it. i think i need to shower and go look at pictures of puppies or something.

537,"hi,
im new to this game. i only found another space ships after surveing lots of systems. i still dont understand how the game works, for example what are districts for and what are the small red/green boxes below each district. or how many planets should i colonize ,but i seem to like this game.
i only have the base game for now and i would like to ask what would be the best dlc for me to buy of the 3. should i just play the base game for now? or im missing stuff from dlcs? 

thanks"
538,"i'm having a bit of an issue on a modded game. this wasn't happening last time i had the game loaded up, and no mods have changed to my knowledge...

basically, when i left-click to select a planet or system, it just radiates little circles from it rather than opening the interface. colonized and habitable planets, as well as colonized systems, and ships, all having a name tag below them, are selectable by clicking the tag.

the issue, however, becomes rather major when trying to enter a system to find something. if that system is not colonized, or is not near another colonized system, you have enter the closest system, then attempt to navigate the hyperlane arrows (which itself can be quite glitchy).

has anyone had a similar issue and/or know what the cause is?

any help/advise is greatly appreciated!"
539,"should cyborgs be able to live on machine worlds? in the cybernetic descriptions it states they switched out organic parts of themselves so could they be altered to survive on a world as hostile as a machine world? maybe require the biological ascension and get access to a trait or world preference dedicated to machine worlds? or would you say that they shouldn’t be able to for balance reasons. 

also should synth ascensions get access to machine worlds? "

541,the game now crashes upon loading my mix of mods that was already problematic when i installed them.
542,"so i was role playing as the galactic empire from star wars. decided to play ironman so i could get some achievements. i went for straight up domination of all with an imperial cult around my all-powerful leader emperor palpatine. all was going well: i was expanding all over the place, won a few early wars, and my economy was very strong. as i started discovering other empires and making a few claims over some systems to keep my expansion going, they decided to form a huge federation. of course shortly after they declared war on me. i was equipped to handle it when all of the sudden the ass hole fanatic purifiers on the opposite border of my empire decided they would start another war. i got absolutely decimated on both fronts to say the least. i lost all my fleets and about half of my planets. i had no choice but to surrender in each war. the icing on the cake is the federation made me adopt their ethos so now my people are all unhappy and insurrections are cropping up everywhere. my economy is in utter shambles so i can't upgrade or buy anything, my fleets are gone, and i'm losing planets fast. the federation did allow me join them so i have some protection, but they're otherwise not much help. is there any hope to come out of this or am i completely screwed? i want to keep playing the save and have my empire's redemption story but this is incredibly frustrating!"
543,"hello guys,

i've been playing a game as a spiritualist/militarist/xenophobic empire (hello valar) and turned into a feudal empire. i've been creating vassals out of my distant sectors and out of recently the rare - was playing ultra defensively - conquered systems, giving the ability to the xenos to rule their lands as they wanted (i'm still a good guy).

it allowed me to play tall pretty well, having only 3 ""core"" planets (until the worm offered me 12 in my starting stellar system), and keeping my vassals loyal, offering them sectors in order to keep my admin stats not to high, one of my vassal even being twice more bigger than me.

these guys were awesome allies in war, working better than a federation, and i ""finished"" the game in 2500 just behind the fe empire (he was 25k points or something, i was at 24k).

do you think it would be a valid strategy to play exclusively around that ? keeping a few system himself and letting vassals spread over the galaxy while defending your borders ?

sorry for long post, kinda hard for me to explain it more precisely"
544,"i finished flesh is weak special project and all my worker species became unemployed specialists. is it a bug?

my economy is in a free fall now and i am in ironmode so i can't just load a save. how long will it take for a pop to demote? do i have any chance to survive that? does this promotion happens every time you completes flesh is weak or i am just unlucky. looks like this perk is toxic now."
545,"one of the best games i ever played in terms of flavor, i was a mechanically ascended race and built a ringworld sanctuary-world where xenos of all races could immigrate freely. i basically became a less creepy version of an ancient caretaker fe. it was awesome.

so it got me thinking : why is there such a strong distinction between gestalt races and non-gestalt races? why arent the latter not allowed to inhabit worlds owned by the former?

why can't a hive mind or machine empire be fundamentally benevolent to other races and be willing to build a home for them? or why couldn't it be tempted by the idea of becoming worshipped as a god by the lesser organics that it gracefully hosts? hiveminds can be petty, too. :p

(assimilating pops doesn't count, because assimilated pops become part of the hivemind. you can't worship yourself. well, you can, but... it's not the same. you get my point.)

(rogue servitor machine intelligences don't count either, because these guys aren't benevolent, they're insane. building a golden prison for a bunch of lazy organics is not like build them a proper home.)

i understand the mechanics for jobs/planet management/etc. are very different in gestalt empires, but surely there's a way around that. maybe allowing gestalt empires to turn specific planets into ""normal"" ones, made for regular pops?"
546,"just had my first minor battle (talking fleets below 3k here) and the game is like a slideshow. even after the battle and after restarting the game it stutters like crazy. before the battle it was only a bit laggy. i play on a 800 star galaxy, and do use some graphical mods. it keeps lagging even after the minor battle is over. i have decent specs, so that should not be the cause. any ideas? when i reload the save before the battle the it works fine, until the battle starts again. could it be due to a mod? i use nsc2 and the mod that adds tons of ship components.

it also doesn't matter where i zoom, galaxy map or star system, it is a slideshow with both."
547,currently facing economic heat death yet again :(
548,"i'll grant you, the budget screen wasn't that well designed in this game to begin with, and it only gave you info for what was going on at the present moment, but since 2.2 it seems as though the budget screen has been completely done away with. in my current game, my economy keeps fluctuating drastically from +347ec to -98ec and i genuinely have no idea why. i've checked everything in my empire and i cannot find a cause. i'd love to know if there's a budget screen squirled away somewhere i'm just missing, but it's not on the empire panel like it used to be. "
549,"so, if you like to play machine empires you probably already know that *something* is off. when playing i was annoyed mostly by growth rate and energy upkeep for jobs and pops. 

growth: i am aware that there is an overall slower progression, and the growthrates are lower for everybody ( -are they really?). but i constantly throughout the whole game felt that i was just waiting on new pops. i did what i could to alleviate this. i resettled pops to new colonies to fill them up to 5pops (later 10) to unlock additional replicator jobs, i also took the growth rate traits and civics, 'mass produced' and 'rapid replicator'. still felt like it was *the* bottleneck. but this could just take some getting used to, playing in a state of constant grwoth *can* be fine, if the other problems get solved.

energy: even in mid to late game i regularly had to micromanage the job distribution, because energy was in the red all of a sudden. after a pass over all planets (mainly lowering maintenance job priority so that energy jobs were filled) i regularly went from -20 to +100.
the upkeep was generally so steep, that only after i had 20 machine worlds and a partial dyson sphere i didnt worry about energy income anymore. before that, i was constantly pressured to keep a weak fleet and not to build too many starbases. in fact, didnt fight any wars at all (even though the ai would have made it easy on me, considering their weak fleets even in lategame).

the high upkeep thing is made worse by the fact you cannot adequatly react through robomodding. for a read on robomodding problems, let me refer you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a6989b/synthetic_ascencion_creates_huge_problems/) by the way i am aware that machine worlds are great, but they become relevant pretty late in the game. at the point that i can have machine worlds, i do not have any problems anymore anyway. 

what bugs me most, however, is that none of the features mentioned in the devdiaries made it into the game.

from [stellaris dev diary #124 - planetary rework (part 4 of 4)](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/stellaris-dev-diary-124-planetary-rework-part-4-of-4.1117775/) ( [reddit version](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/9dhgup/stellaris_dev_diary_124_planetary_rework_part_4/e5hl7qz/) ) :

&gt;machine empires
&gt;
&gt;machine empires share some similarities with hive minds, but rather than being focused on rapid growth, **their primary focus is efficient use of resources.** like the hive minds, they have their own version of housing district, the nexus district, and **their resource extraction districts also provide three jobs where normal empires get two,** but in addition to this they also have substantial bonuses to finished goods production, with **jobs such as the fabricator being a more efficient and productive variant of the regular alloy-producing metallurgist.** however, this comes at the expense of being unable to naturally produce new pops, having to rely on costly replicator jobs to construct new drones. machine empires are ideal for an empire that wants to be self-sustaining, and truly shine when they have access to numerous kinds of natural resources.

- i can confirm that my me only has two jobs per mining district instead of three.

- my fabricators change 12 minerals into 4 alloys (base). that is just the same amount the zerg get in my other game, meaning that this bonus, as well, isnt given to machine empires.

- so, we have the downsides (costly replicator jobs for bad growth) without the upsides as they were announced in the dev diary (bonus mineral and energy job per district, bonus alloy production).

since i cannot visit regulularly these days, i might have missed some tweet or announcement, acknowledging some of me's issues. does anybody have any info on this?"
550,"i've seen some mentions of attempts at fixing them, but i'm not clear how substantial the changes were.  my current game is reaching the end of it's playable life, and i'm torn between trying a criminal megacorp or a robot-oriented organic empire."
551,"due to some changes in 2.2, any custom empires created before 2.2 will have a starting ruler with no traits.

the fix for this is to create a new empire and redo everything and delete the old one.

&amp;#x200b;

if, like me, you have a lot of custom empires, that fix is not good enough!

&amp;#x200b;

so, here's how to do it without having to recreate all your custom empires:

&amp;#x200b;

1. find your user\_empire\_designs.txt file. this should be in \\documents\\paradox interactive\\stellaris
2. open the file in a text editor and for every empire there should be an entry like this:

&amp;#x200b;

    ruler={
    	gender=male
    	name=""name""
    	portrait=""human""
    	texture=0
    	hair=5
    	clothes=4
    }

3.  add leader\_class=""ruler"" to every ruler entry like so:

&amp;#x200b;

    ruler={
    	gender=male
    	name=""name""
    	portrait=""human""
    	texture=0
    	hair=5
    	clothes=4
    	leader_class=""ruler""
    }

&amp;#x200b;

4. save file and enjoy :)"
552,"since in practice they're going to be uninhabitable for you anyway, i've been thinking, how hard would it be to make them spawn as barren terraforming candidated instead

i know how mars is done, but i'm not sure it would be possible to set a condition that does that for the predetermined colonies in the randomized preset neighbor systems "
553,"what is the most simplest and easy (less resources / things to manage) race for this game?

&amp;#x200b;

is it machines since they dont need food and can, in theory, live forever?

&amp;#x200b;

also, speaking of machines, what are the best traits/perks or whatnot i need to pick when making them to have some good playthrus?  usually i have been taking leader exp +25, leader level +1, leader level +2 and -25%pop growth at the start. and one more, i forgot, 10% more something (it is a negative one).

&amp;#x200b;

554,"has anyone else noticed that during the process of building the stage 1 ringworld, it's centered on the ringworld site, not the star in the system? i've only started noticing this in 2.2 and am pretty sure it didn't exist in prior versions.

thanks,"
555,"i haven't played in about a year and im considering downloading the new expansion, but i heard that they totally revised the entire economy. i've seen posts where undocking your fleet can result in total economic collapse.

i really don't have a lot of time to totally relearn the game ck2 style, so did this game get hard? or is it still manageable."
556,"i've just been on a receiving end of a robot uprising. i had about 40 robots across my empire with 2k total pops. i've lost about 6 well developed worlds in the initial flip. considering there was only like 40 robot pops, the amount of hardware they can put on the field is impressive.

my empire is not lost, the fleets are powerfull enough to destroy the uprising. but just the amount of damage that the uprising does is crazy. i think i will abandon this game, and will probably not build any robot pops in the future, just not worth it.

and how did they rebel anyway? i haven't researched the synths."
557,"it's been almost 40 years war exhaustion is only at 17%, both sides still have massive fleets i've lost my entire navy twice and army once, both minerals and energy have had deficits for 50 years, the borders of several areas have completed changed, most empires have had 1 or 2 rebellions, balkanization has occured in the north and massively in the east and west, the west has completely collapsed from the great kahn, its successor states and now it's the main battleground between the awaken empires, there is 0 strength over there and the border gore is disgusting.

the last two wars in heaven i've had ended in 10 year or less how long do they last in 2.2 ? (i'm not complaining this most fun war in heaven i've ever had, i'm just curious)

563,"this was originally a response to another post but as it's something i've been mulling over for a while (including wondering whether i should create a mod) i thought i'd give it it's own post.

as the next mechanics expansion is likely some kind of diplo rework i'm gonna throw my ideas out there.

the idea is to rework how nations interact to provide more varied options for temporary or permanent agreements between nations inspired by various treaties and igos throughout history. the concepts should be simple but the variety should create a complex web of intergalactic relations which would add an extra layer to the game that a player could fully engage with - so fanatic pacifists could politic their way to peaceful galaxy and hegemons could use their influence to lean on smaller nations and over time remove their autonomy. alternatively the player could ignore most of it and use presets for the most common treaties such as alliances, pacts etc. in the midgame aggressive expansionists will be busy with war with maybe mild politics to destabilise rivals they're not warring with while more peaceful nations will be securing peace and ""federations"" will be full of member states politicking to acquire more influence to exert more control over the other members.

&amp;#x200b;

**concept**

i'd introduce two new mechanics: ""**treaties**"" and ""**igos**"" (intergovernmental organisations).

a treaty would be a list of ""articles"" (agreements/obligations) that would be picked from a list - some will have further options. (some maybe ""one shot"" and/or one sided.)

any nation could propose a treaty to any other nation which could agree/decline/amend.

peace talks would trigger a cease fire while the victor proposes a treaty to the loser. this would go back and forth between winner and loser amending the articles until they both agree. the decisiveness of the victory could maybe influence how much the loser can amend the treaty. (ideally all sovereign states should agree on the treaty but maybe just war leaders).

the various articles in a treaty could be limited by various factors such as situation (peace talks), relationship (ally, rival, vassal etc.) and tech ('cos why not? - maybe advances in social engineering are required to maximise a complex or lop sided deal).

igos would effectively replace alliances, federations etc. and would model the various relationships and agreements between nations. (of course, some agreements are more equal than others.)

treaties are named after the proposers homeworld/wargoal and can be renamed.

igos formed from treaties would have a dynamic name based on the type of articles in it and of course could be renamed.

&amp;#x200b;

**result**

this sort of system should allow various forms of treaties to be signed resulting in a myriad of relationships. igos could evolve over time adding more agreements which would have to be voted on (or maybe not ;)

&amp;#x200b;

a simple peace treaty could comprise of a one off energy payment (war reparations).

a more advanced peace treaty may impose restrictions on fleet cap or ship production.

some igos would have articles that all members agree to and would evolve over time to include more articles or amend existing ones.

some igos would have unification or increased centralisation in mind. of course, imposing more restrictions on members would piss them off resulting in their withdrawal (opinion hit to other members) or finding allies in other members to amend the agreements to be more favourable.

failure and collapse of an igo should be a very real possibility but it will also evolve as the galactic landscape or member state situations change.

a war may result in a treaty where some participants agree and stop fighting while others continue the war. (which would thus need a separate treaty amongst the remaining combatants).

&amp;#x200b;

**examples**

**space hre**

this would be formed by a number of nations agreeing to a treaty that involves periodical elections for ruler of the igo and the current ruler able to enact articles without the need to be veto'd by other members. there are no articles covering wars between members so they are free to fight each other. but it may include an article where the ruler ""should"" (opinion hit otherwise) help defend against external aggressors.

if a member gets too powerful others may conspire to vote someone else into power.

**space un**

this igos treaty would cover military campaigns and tech articles. effectively a research agreement (for military tech only) but restrictions on offensive wars unless all agree. (maybe even have permanent seats for founders/most powerful that can veto a decision).

**space mongolia**

every time you win a war the loser signs a treaty that obliges them to pay periodic tribute. beat up everyone, tributize the galaxy.

**space eu**

economic treaty with articles concerning trade, migration and law.

&amp;#x200b;

**other random thoughts**

nations may belong to several igos (kinda like now with various pacts, trade/tech agreements) but there would have to be restrictions to avoid certain combinations. the concept of ""independence"" would be less ""yes or no"" and be more granular.  certain articles would have to be mutuality exclusive (such as a suzerain) but many others won't be (such as defensive pacts, research agreements etc).

a typical vassal might have signed a treaty that submits them to a suzerain, paying periodic tribute but also a defensive article calling the suzerain to war if the vassal is attacked. the treaty may or may not allow the vassal to expand, start their own wars etc. and because vassalage would be a treaty it could be amended over time by the suzerain via increased economic and political control over the vassal. this could replace a one click integration button with an evolving relationship with its ups and downs but the time it takes could be the same.

other forms of subordination would also be possible such as simple tributaries to  shogun/daimyo relationships. a state with many vassals could evolve into a federations or union and eventually a single, sovereign state.

presets would be available for those that don't want to create custom treaties for common treaties such as defensive pacts, research agreements, migration treaties etc.

articles could have an ""obligation level"" such as ""must"" or ""should"". ""must"" obligations cannot be avoided - such as defensive pact treaties where all members automatically join the war in defence. ""should"" obligations are not mandatory but will incur an opinion penalty.

wars, treaties, igo formation/dissolution could be ""historic moments"" that go in a galactic history journal.

i think belief systems should be in the game - in name at least if not various bonuses etc. just to give another opinion modifier. i've never been a fan of the ""spiritualist is abstract religion"" 'cos different religions often don't get on. a militaristic fanatic spiritualist may want to conquer or convert all that is not their religion. a non-spiritualist empire may be more tolerant of his neighbours with different religions. in wh40k the empire of man has a religion that sees the emperor as a god - but they're more materialistic than spiritual. their techs are priests that do ""holy rituals"" aka operating machinery) and those with psychic powers are either sent to power the emporers golden throne or killed for being a potential conduit of chaos. so a nation can have a religion without being spiritual. a spiritualist in an igo, if he gets elected or is suzerain, may impose an article that forces everyone to declare his a state religion. you might agree because you don't care about your peoples bs but your trading partner might...

&amp;#x200b;

nb: while this may seem complex the key idea is that a treaty is not much more than a list of options, like the policy screen, that has some equal or one sided effects for signatories and not all options would be available all the time. the ai could use the presets to achieve what it already does with the ""hard coded"" treaties/igo(federation) except it will allow players to better roleplay international relations and create the type of organisations they want.

&amp;#x200b;

could it work? is it too flexible for paradox? ;) should i mod it?"
564,"i colonized a planet with pre sapients. my policy was set to extermination but they weren't getting purged so i changed to hunted but that didn't do anything too. it says they are slaves and cost upkeep, and they count as 3 jobs for some reason.

565,"i've always thought it would be cool to have a pre-made scenario, with little unclaimed systems, empires of various sizes and power, and other stuff. kind of like a stellaris version of hoi4/ck2/eu4 start dates, except sci-fi and fictional.

566,"hello there! to celebrate the end of my finals, i’m gonna host a lan party with a few friends and they all want to try the new stellaris xpac. they did not played 2.2 yet, and with the school stuff i could not play more than a few halfassed start, so my personal knowledge doesn’t go far either.

is there any tips, advices or recommandations that you would give to old players trying 2.2 for a casual game of stellaris? from basics too complex, passing by fleet comp and planet management, everything is welcomed.

thanks in advance!"
567,"holy shit.

i've been kind of busy this year, and haven't been able to play any stellaris since a little after the 2.0 update. so now that i'm on winter break, i figured i'd boot it up to play some more. i was not prepared for what i would find.

totally different planet lay out, 2 more base resources, what seems like 2 more special resources, a ton more buildings, totally different ways of developing the planet and organising pops, geeez i need to spend 200 years just to re-learn what the hell is even going on.

i'm a huge fan of just these changes just on seeing them haven't even advanced a day yet. the game, back when i played, was pretty easy to get started with expansion and exploration, and the game always sort of slogged on past 2350 or 2400 or so just because it took so long to do anything and everything always felt like busy work. this seems so much more intricate, and even the simple opportunity of relearning basic of the game is very attractive.

i'm looking forward to this"
568,"so i'm having a hard time figuring out how exactly to produce consumer goods, i can only find ways to use them. i'm playing as humans which are wasteful and its catching up to me. the only answer i kinda found is that they are produced just from having buildings? is this true?"
569,"i got a couple robots from conquering a mechanist empire next door, and now (after i forgot to micromanage every single planet i have because ~~update 2.2 is an unfinished mess~~ reasons), i have 26 robots that are, in every single way, inferior to my main species.

i can't modify them to be on par, because they lack one trait pick for that, and they don't change into my main species, because ~~update 2.2 is an unfinished mess~~ of some inexplainable reason. is there a way to either assimilate them, exterminate them or anything to stop me from having to prioritize my main species on every single planet?"
570,"the research tree is a bit of a mess at the moment, especially since theres more techs than before and when you really need a specific tech to come up \*cough, cough\* *strategic resources* \*cough, cough\* it doesnt. i have a few ideas to fix that without getting rid of the semi-random tech tree or rid of techs in general. (sorry if these have already been suggested, i genuinely don't know if they have)

1. make it so that the repeatable techs, that are bloating the tree at the moment, are always available and do not count against your current number of research cards. that way they stay out of the way for the more important techs to appear.
2. to thin out the randomness either revamp research agreements, so that you can always research techs that the    other empire(s) have researched, or instead of that keep research agreements as they are but allow for 'tech-trading'. if you buy a tech from an empire that has researched it, it doesn't give you the tech, just a small percentage as occurs with some of the exploration events in the game.
3. please, for the love of god, make the strategic resource techs the pre-requisite to the buildings that require them. yes, you can get them through commerce stations, the market or with buildings, but often it's not an attractive or smart choice to sustain long term trades like that in the earlier part of the game, or give up a whole building slot just because you can't exploit the 5 crystals in the system right next to you. the other options should be used if you dont have them in your space, or as mid/late game development.

572,"i am currently in a space communism playthrough and the second empire i encountered was a corporate authority. in true roleplay fashion, i immediately declared war on them when they placed their corporate office on my planets. dirty capitalists are not making money off of my people. i know that you can do an ideology casus belli but as far as i know, this doesn't apply to civics, and me doing that would just turn them into the same ethics as my empire. it would be neat to have some sort of ""embrace communism"" casus belli that forces them to embrace the same ethics and also the shared burdens civic. of course it would have a higher war score cost, but it would be fun to use. "
573,are the production mandates (make +6 consumer goods/month) bugged? i've got +20 production but it failed. am i misunderstanding something?
574,"  

so, yes, i’m loving 2.2 and the planetary rework and all that, but it seriously needs a rebalance patch, like right now.

here is a little list of the things that really annoy me in the current state of the game:

*  the ai is garbage(ai empires) in general, they don’t build stuff, they never use the galactic market(i be never seen a slave for sale, for example),
*  when new specialist jobs are created the ai prefers to ascend workers rather than employ unemployed specialist,
*  the pop growth really needs some tweaks. first, for example, if you have many species in you empire you may have pops growing in a planet of 20% habitability, instead of prioritising the ones with 80%. second, i would like to keep population ratios, meaning that if i have 9 humans in a planet and 1 duck i would like to keep that 9:1 ratio, instead the ai prefers to achieve a 1:1, and if i prioritise species i get less growth speed,
*  as far as i understand alloys where passed in a ratio of 1:1 from minerals in 2.1, meaning that if a ship costed you 10   
minerals in 2.1, now its 10 alloys. this annoys me as alloys are much harder to get than minerals,
*  is cheaper to make a new fleet rather than upgrade it. what?!?! also upgrade times are just crazy, you can have a fleet upgrading for three years and after that time new research has come in,
*  this patch was supposed to have lots of optimisation for the late game. yeah. i day every three second, like really?? its more of a slideshow the late game,
*  the new sector system is garbage. it doesn’t help with micromanagement and i end up having 20 sectors with 1 planet each, which is annoying from a ui point of view,
*  some tweaks to criminal syndicate. every time i shut down their branch offices, they just open up a new one one year later. so i have to declare them war again.

so, does anyone knows if this will be fixed or balanced?"
575,"i have finals next week. this game is on sale. guess what i've been doing instead of studying.

583,"i realize there's a patch incoming that may or may not address some of this, but i had a lot of time to think while i was flying for the holidays and decided to write down some ideas around megacorp mechanics and the current state of criminal syndicates. i'd like to know what you all think. sorry in advance for the wall-o-text.

inb4 ""this makes the game way more complicated"". legitimate concern, but not what i'm going for here.


my primary issues are:
 
- limit of one branch office per colony presents a wall to other megacorps that really has no recourse outside wiping them off the face of the galaxy (that i'm aware of)
- criminal syndicates' branch offices feel a bit too ""parasitic"", resulting in immediate precinct spam to get rid of it. i've experienced the ai doing this immediately after establishing a branch office, and have certainly acted this way towards any syndicate branches opened on my worlds.
- as a non-corporate empire, i don't feel like there's much of a decision when determining whether or not to establish a commercial pact. it's basically: can you spare the influence for some more energy? i wish there was more distinction between the megacorps and some form of corporate competition for your business.
- i'd like to see opportunities for stronger economic ties between megacorps and empires. 


so here's what i propose. some items synergize, others are independent:

- remove the branch office per colony limit, allowing multiple megacorps to establish branch offices on the same world
- the criminal syndicate trait should be added as a hidden trait
 - the criminal syndicate should be able to operate as a normal megacorp, including *initially* requiring commercial pacts to establish branch offices.
 - their branch office buildings should appear, to the host empire, to be normal megacorp buildings.
  - criminal syndicates should be able to toggle the criminal element of each building, providing increasing bonuses over time to that building's unique resource output at the cost of crime rate increase (which also increases over time relative to the bonus you receive)
  - all empires should be able to ""launch criminal investigation "" into the alleged criminal activities of *any* megacorp. this could be implemented as a diplomatic option akin to ""insult"" that would initiate a special research action (same as uplift primitives/species modification) with high research costs.  it would have a negative effect on relations with that megacorp, with a partial recovery upon vindication of the megacorp's activities. a successful investigation would reveal the hidden criminal syndicate trait on the megacorp and then *give the empire the diplomatic option to expel the branch office by revoking their commercial pact*.
  - upon being expelled, the criminal syndicate could be granted the ability to establish illicit (aka without a pact) branch offices within the empire that would operate more like spies do in civilization, wherein they can sabotage production, kill leaders/pops/buildings, steal resources or tech, etc. with this, a criminal syndicate is still a threat, but the open hostility allows subterfuge and sabotage to take over what was previously a business relationship.
        - (going out on a limb here) we could introduce the possibility of the investigation failing to uncover any hard evidence of criminality. it could be implemented as a cat and mouse game, where the investigator has to choose a specific building in the megacorp's branch office to investigate (or the base branch office if no other buildings exist). the type of building investigated could determine the research type cost. upon being notified of the investigation, the criminal syndicate, not knowing which of their assets is being watched, toggles off the criminal activity for all of their buildings, *immediately* losing out on the bonus output from those buildings and *over time* reducing the crime rate output of the buildings. the success/failure of the investigation could be measured by averaging the total crime rate produced by the building in question over the number of months the investigation took, then doing an rng roll with the avg crime / month factored in. i've no idea how this should be balanced, i just like the idea. 
- all megacorps should be able to choose a 0-point-cost resource specialization ~~civic~~ *trait* that allows their branch offices to also provide the chosen resource to the host colony. 
 - e.g. choosing the ""agribusiness"" specialization allows your branch offices to provide food alongside the normal energy bonus. i expect these numbers would need to be balanced appropriately, but for the purpose of illustration let's say this agribusiness's branch office has just been built, and provides a ratio of energy-to-food of 4:1. when the planet's population increases, so would the production of these resources, as currently implemented. 
 - new branch office buildings could provide further bonuses to this resource production
 - to account for relative value of alloys/consumer goods vs energy/mins/food, the base energy provided by the branch office from an alloy or consumer goods specialized megacorp may need to be reduced accordingly.
 - this mechanic would have the effect of making a megacorp feel more economically intertwined with its host empires. an empire that has a high percentage of its food provided by its corporate partners is not likely to build agricultural infrastructure as they normally would, increasing the cost of bad relations with the megacorp.
- implement a ""corporate warfare"" mechanic for megacorps to fight for market share on a planet. this effectively splits the energy that the competing megacorps take home.
  - market share could be affected by a number of factors. just to name a few ideas:
     1. relations with the host empire
     2. distance from the host empire
     3. length of time your branch office has been established relative to the competing megacorp branch offices
     4. percentage of resource output (any resource) your branch office provides to that world relative to the competing megacorp output
     5. edicts that represent your company's pr and/or marketing efforts. e.g. ""buy three get one free"" : increase your specialization resource output by 25%. ""accuse the competition"" : your empire publicly accuses the competition of being a criminal syndicate, reducing the diplomatic trust of the customer towards the accused.
  - these options would still provide obstacles to other megacorps' attempts to ""jump into the market"" with an already-entrenched competitor. however, i believe the above list could provide enough options to potentially make the uphill climb by ""schmoozing"" the customer empire and ousting the competition.

edit: i meant to describe the resource specialization option as a trait rather than a civic."

we're also working to allow mods within the game if you're like me and just need that one extra thing for the best playing experience."
585,"story time:

with the release of le guin and megacorp i was hyped to play multiplayer with 2 of my friends. a few days ago, we were finally able to start a medium game, one as a normal empire, the other friend as life-seeded and myself as megacorp.  
we made good headway into the galaxy, discovering each other, discovering the ai empires, everything was fine. until the great khan attacked.

we fell into a panic. playing on 2.2, we had no increased alloy production and were stuck on a plus of 20 alloys each, our fleets underdeveloped and little to no bastions close to the khan.  
luckily, we rallied, calmed down and used the time that was given to us by two buffer empires, both would suffer horendously throughout the conflict. i built up a bastion in the system where i knew the khan would come sooner or later, buying up alloys on the market and continously hiring mercs from the marauders in the galaxy. meanwhile, my friends were tasked with holding their northern possessions and maybe save the ai federation member (spoiler: the ai became a satrapy).

the war got into full swing, i used my fleets to sally out beyond the safety of my bastion to destroy horde stations and construction ships, until the khan himself decided that he needed to break my stronghold. he was severely outnumbered and outgunned but still went through with his attack. we got cheerful as we saw the health of his galleon tick down. laughter as his ship blew up. then, silence and disenchantment. the khan survived, we had to keep fighting and living.

contingency plans were made, my friends were ready to surrender, because it was at this time that one ai ceased to exist and the other one became the khans satrapy. the breaking point was drawing closer, one friend being enraged that the khan could just spawn fleets close to his systems (he didn't, those were just fleets that the khan transitioned from my front).  
then, an event fired: the khan is dead, assassinated by an unknown kill team. the suffering for us was over, at least momentarily.

now my friends have to rest and rebuild, one of them has to reorganize his economy, it lying in shambles after he charged headlong into the update without thinking much.

nevertheless, this was one of the most enjoyable sessions i had in stellaris. before 2.2 we were strong fast, a khan being no real obstacle when spawning in 2300. now it felt like a desperate fight for survival, gambles being taken and lost. a story worth telling."
586,"playing my organic hive mind devouring swarm play-through the past few days (really fun by the way) and i can't help but feel that there's something missing: organic ships. these have been seen in sci-fi in various forms: tyranids, zerg, yuzon-vong, the shivans, vorlons, shadows, the lex, our very own prethoryns, etc. and what are some good organic ship set mods that are out there?"
587,"so the community has been wanting player controlled nomad/marauder empires for a while now but most concepts are no longer viable, so here's my 2.2 viable concept for nomads with a few possible civics

&amp;#x200b;

*the world ship we inhabit is as old as the universe we live in, we know not it's origin but it's destiny is clear; all the stars will be it's domain and know it's might.*

&amp;#x200b;

# world ships

pops need a place to live but the void is rather... inhospitable to life to say the least. world ships are the nomadic solution to this problem, a large habitable ship that your pops can live on.

**mechanics**

* has a planet tab with a number of named (and buffed) buildings that can be built on it (such as a ""mineral synthesizer"" which acts in the same way as a mine).
* instead of orbiting a star it can enter a ""gathering"" mode that can provide bonuses and resources that reduce over time, when not being gathered the star regenerates. if completely emptied regeneration takes significantly longer.
* gathering mode destroys any structures surrounding the star in question.
* gathering mode allows the world ship to build military craft.
* can build ""support craft"" instead of districts, serve the same purpose but exist as separate entities in the same fleet as the world ship, cannot leave the fleet.
* when the world ship loses all it's health it becomes temporarily disabled.
* world ship cannot be destroyed normally, must be ""boarded"" (for all intensive purposes it works like planetary occupation, can be bombarded). cannot be repaired while bombarded.
* more world ships can be built at a large expense.
* does not have a military value, support craft do. 

# gameplay

* can raid (attack stations without entering a war) to gain resources, starts the game raiding stance for planets.
* has a ""nomad tributary"" cb. upon victory the loser becomes a ""nomad tributary"" that gives the nomad 25% of their fleet size and 15% of their economy. 
* any planets in the empire are automatically converted to nomad tributaries.
* cannot raid nations with non-aggression pacts, allies or federation members.
* fleets can enter a ""pirate stance"" which allows you to siphon trade income from other empires.
* trade routes cannot be utilized.

**civics**

* military estate: assault armies -60% upkeep +30% assault. *before our attention turned to the stars we were a military estate for an oppressive regime, with this experience our military doctrine drives our peoples*
* imposing presence:  -10% happiness for every shared border. *neighboring empires fear our might, their populations grow discontent and rebellious the longer their state allows us to occupy their borders, perhaps this aggression can benefit us.*
* exiles and brigands: +100% immigration pull. *we are widely known as a country of opportunity for the ""less than desirable"" members of other nations, our borders are open to anyone willing to serve.*
* tradition of war: -20% war exhaustion, -10% when not at war for long periods of time. *our population does not seem to tire from conflict. we cannot disappoint them, can we?*

**empire titles**

* hetmanate: spiritualist/militarist/egalitarian and not xenophobic
* khanate: xenophobic
* host: materialist not xenophobic

this concept is meant to play off the new mechanics in an interesting way as well as introduce new but simple mechanics based loosely off of history (primarily cossacks and cumans) as well as ck2. i feel like this system could have a number of game changing civics and would be great fun to play while not feeling op with a few examples above. i honestly would love to play this kind of empire."
588,"howdy all,

hope you're well, just want to know how to be better at this game and how to get good. i got the basics down and i've played a lot of civ so i don't need a high level overview, but getting into the mid-late game i'm starting to see how godawful my empire is organized and how much knowledge i'm lacking. would appreciate some advice and/or resources to read. "
589,"i mean, i'm pretty surprised this isn't in the game already. sacrifices are like the cornerstone of evil cults, which most spiritualist races end up being anyway. and it's not like there would be no reason to do it either, we already know of creatures in the shroud that love to feast on beings from our galaxy. why not let us feed them willingly to collect rewards? you could even tier the rewards based on the number of sacrifices. 

it would be an especially good way to deal with a galactic refugee crisis, or a good solution to the ongoing question ""what do we do with the slaves we just conquered"".

in a time of emergency, it would be an interesting option to let someone sacrifice all but one pop in exchange for salvation."
590,"anyone wanna link me some pics of their habitats in 2.2? mine are feeling very weak, limited, and constrained. i know i'm doing something wrong, but i want to see how others are setting theirs up."
591,"i was under the impression that wormholes, you could use whenever you wanted. but with gateways, both ends of it had to be in friendly territory or else you could not travel through them. 

well here comes the khan and he has full access to every l-gate whenever he wants. it quickly turned into a game of whack-a-mole as he could appear anywhere on the map.

do that mean gateways work the same way as wormholes, or are l-gates different. cause it means that your territory becomes very difficult to defend and lock down when it has as many access points as a chunk of cheese. 

also, are the l-gates connected to the regular gateways in the same way or are they two different networks?"
592,why do i bother trying to play hive minds...
593,"so, i woke up this morning and went to hop on stellaris as i've recently gotten back into it after playing 2,000 hours on eu4 (yikes). when i opened the game, however, i went to load my game, and noticed that the emblem i had downloaded was not on the flag for my save file. i start the game and it crashes. then, i re-open the launcher and notice that my mod screen is 100% empty. i had like 15-25 mods and i'd hate to have to find them all again."
594,"after i load the game all of my resources are wildly negative, -125 energy, -25 consumer goods, you get the picture but last night, when i last saved the game everything was fine. this isn't the wierd resource quirk that happens everytime you load the game and that dissapears after a month, i've ran the game for a couple of months and its still happening. send help

edit: now another thing thats happening is that my resources are oscillating wildly, one month its 100 energy and 30 minerals the other its something compleatly different. this is also happening with resources i dont trade like consumer good so its not market price fluctuation changing my energy income"
595,"i have been an avid player of stellaris since the utopia expansion. i believe they have been making great strides since then by making borders make more sense, and things being generally more consistent. however, not all things are perfect. being diplomatic as a regular empire still isn't fun. as a mega-corporation, you gain a variety of bonuses from commercial pacts and such. but for a normal empire diplomatic options are much more lack luster. whenever i join a federation i am always dragged into unnecessary wars with the rival federation, while there fleet fails to do anything as i carry the war or my allies rise to 100% war exhaustion. i think they need a federation rehaul. eu4 (a game i have much less experience with) has a much better diplomatic system. alliances gain trust points which can be spent towards calling allies in wars. these points can be accumulated over time based off of your strength or helping an ally in the war. in a federation system, you could not only spend these points on calling a war but gaining influence, unity, energy, etc. an easier problem to solve would be allowing allies to call for piece separately, giving a relations minus to the betrayed but letting people escape a fateful war."
596,"so after playing hive mind devouring swarm and having a blast with it, i've decided to put it down for now and move onto a different empire, but first not without bringing some issues to light that i've found during my game. some are more personal changes, some are general qol improvements and some are specific to hive mind but all should make the game slightly better in some regard. (in my mind anyway), so let's get started. 

* tool tip for food when eating population doesn't actually tell you how much food you're getting from eating population alone - [this](http://prntscr.com/lv6sin). now this isn't a major problem but some specification would be nice in knowing how much food i'm actually getting from stuffing my face with lovely xeno flesh.
* the population resettlement screen becomes borderline unusable when you reach around 1500 population or there about. when i say borderline unusable i mean it lags so much that at one point i thought my game had crashed. this is a problem because when conquering worlds, without nerve stapling entire species, they all sit on a their planet and are just a thorn in your side, so the only other solution is to spread them across your empire via the resettlement screen. i can't imagine how lagging it's going to be now i have [this](http://prntscr.com/lv6u1q) much population.
* construction notification doesn't actually tell you what you've finished constructing - i'm sure this has been like this since i can remember. while micro-ing 61 planets, i can't remember everything i build so it would be nice to know what i have just built.
* sector ai does nothing - i sure this is already being worked on by paradox so i wont go into it.
* current sectors are terrible - now, as far as i'm aware, the game creates a sector based on the first planet full colonised in an area with a system radius of 2. examples: [here](http://prntscr.com/lv6v0b), [here](http://prntscr.com/lv6v4t) and [here](http://prntscr.com/lv6vcl). the red boxes represent the first planets i took over in that area and so the sectors were created around that planet. (don't ask what's going on with that 1 sector that has 1 system in it in the second picture, i don't know.) 

now i have an idea on how to make sectors great again, first thing is to make the sector ai do something. half joking aside, bring back the old sector system and allow players to create their own sectors with a minimum of 10 systems to a maximum of 20 systems in a sector, each sector can then be governed by a leader which provides maybe +5 admin cap at 10 systems and an extra +5 at 20 systems for a total of +10. if a sector is not governed by a leader, no admin cap bonus is applied. this isn't a ground breaking amount of admin cap because i'm sitting here with 1385 empire size with 210 admin cap. (to those people saying increase the admin cap, if you actually play into the game, there are at least 7 techs that increase admin cap by 10 each) 

* increase penalties for going ever so slightly - personally i don't feel the penalties at all, now i'm not saying increase them by so much that it makes going wide ridiculously hard and always being crippled, it's just if done right, you can brush away the penalties with building your planets half decently, especially the tech penalty. getting a nice balance between the penalties so they're not crippling when going wide but not so weak like i feel they currently are is a hard thing to do. but this is what the beta branch is for, right?

now my biggest gripe with hive mind...

* hive mind ""unemployed"" population which are ""scavenger drones"". unlike regular empires, when you have unemployed pops you get a little icon to say ""hey, you have unemployed!"". with hive mind you don't because ""scavenger drones"" aren't technically unemployed, they give you a base of 1 mineral for an upkeep on 1.5 food. this means that you have no idea when you've got essentially unemployed population waiting for you to build a building so they can actually contribute to the economy properly. i'd like a little icon to tell me i have scavenger drones, so i don't have to check 61 planets for them. [:(](http://prntscr.com/lv71vr) either that or just classify them as unemployed and get the game to show the appropriate icon just like a normal empire.

now for some personal qol that people might relate to: 

* destroy all buildings/districts button/s - we all know the ai has no idea what it's doing half the time and when you finally get around to taking their juicy looking planets, you find out it's choked full of things you don't need and so you end up just destroying most if not all the buildings and districts to rebuild it the way you like it. i'm just asking for two simple buttons that destroys all the buildings apart from the colony hub thing and all the districts so that we don't spend 5 minutes cleaning up after the ai. 
* a modify all species button - again, going to war as a hive mind means plenty of unrest from your food because nobody likes being eaten alive, maybe a button in the species screen that let's you modify all population that you own. the way this would work is you would first create a template on how you want the species to be, click the ""modify all"" button, a second screen comes up and you select what template you want them to switch to, check the ones you want and click ""confirm"". the game then just adds up the total amount of soc research required and gives you a total time in months, just like normal. hope that makes sense. this way it cuts down going back to the species screen every month to modify the next species in line.
* reconfigure shortcut keys - self explanatory, did i miss the reason why we aren't allowed to reconfigure the shortcut keys?
* jump drive cooldown notification - self explanatory, i like to use jump drives whenever i can when moving across my vast empire that spans the entire galaxy, just a simple notification to let me know when the 200 days cool down is done so i can use them again.
* expand the rare resources tab to show all resources - it looks like you have enough space along the top of the ui to put the rare resources icons, total and per month numbers in so we don't have to keep checking back to see if we can upgrade one of our 600 research labs. 

and last but certainly not least!

* upgrading fleets should use all the available shipyards - you have it so when we build 30 new corvettes to fill the rest of our fleet, all the shipyards are used to pump them out as fast as possible, so how come only one shipyard is allowed to be used when upgrading a fleet? we shouldn't have to split the fleet into the number of shipyards we have and then upgrade them. seems a bit silly.

anyway, that's all, just thought i'd give some ideas about how to make the game possibly better.

599,"i found two really good planets that i'd love to colonize but they both have primitive civilizations on them. i know that i can enlighten them but they still won't be part of my empire. is there a way that i can just kill everyone on the planet?

edit: i just did what you guys suggested. sent an army down there and set the primitives as ""undesirables"" and started exporting them (i don't have xenophobe so i can't straight up purge them). now i'm starting to understand all this purge talk here, this feels good."
600,"i'm currently playing a stellaris run however it's not very difficult as the ais intelligence is so damn abusable, pretty much all they do is pump out big fleets that fight my bigger fleets since they don't seem to understand they can't win and fall way too easily. ai difficulty doesn't seem to improve their strategy either, only the numbers. an example is that they ignore economy and pump out fleets way bigger than their economy should be able to support.

it's not really enjoyable either, as they just keep pumping out ships and retaking the systems i've conquered, so it's basically like a cat and mouse fight. not many mods exist in 2.2 that improve their intelligence either. 

any tips? federations are probably the worst as their allies won't even help them even though the combined federation power is stronger than me."
601,"so i was looking into the paradise lost (mardak vol, vecthar zavonia) quest chain with the change in 2.2, and it has quite a few. most of the bugs have been fixed, but there is a new one. spoilers for the quest chain.

first off the chance of the anomaly is way lower (called ancient hulk). the null_spawn_chance (for all events) was fixed in 2.2, so there is now only a 25% of it potentially happening in a game. this is checked the first time the anomaly is rolled, and if it failures it will never be able to spawn.

next up is the actual chance of it being picked, previously in the first 20 years of the game, it was giving a priority of 7, this dropped to 5 until 50 years then 3 after that. originally (back in the first release) it priority was up around 30-40, which made it almost guaranteed in every game.

the new priority is a flat 0.25, years into the game no longer matter. as you can tell, this is a huge drop in chance of spawning. there is only a 25% of it being able to spawn in the game if it is picked, and only a very small chance of it being picked compared to other anomalies with much higher priorities. so getting this is a pretty big deal now.

now onto the actual changes to the chain.

it’s all the same until you reveal the planet. unlike 2.1, the planet is no longer an almost empty world, previously it would spawn with almost no tile resources. it now has a fairly normal amount of bonuses and blockers (in my test it has 3 features and 1 blocker). there are significantly more mardak vol living on the planet and they have a few basic buildings. this is good, an empty 25 gaia was good, but it felt a bit silly...now it's a proper 25 gaia world.

when the vol turn up to kill all the mardak vol, the choices are the same, but outcomes are different. if you left them purge the mardak vol, they are all instantly killed and one blocker is added to the planet. if you don’t, shortly after their fleet turns up and bombards the planet, same as before. however, this no longer adds any blockers (previously it would make the planet full of blockers) and once they have killed the mardak vol, the fleet with continue to guard the system and not leave, previously they left after killing the mardak vol.

this means you can now pick the second option without losing the planet, but you need to defeat the vol fleet to colonize the system.

tldr: the event is now super rare, the bugs where the planet would lack resources and/or would be uncolonizable have been fixed, but there is a new bug where the vol fleet does not leave after killing the mardak vol."
602,"since my [last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a5vawj/small_tips_for_22/), i've had a chance to learn even more about how to tackle 2.2. here's everything i've learned so far:

# quick tips:

&amp;#x200b;

* the biggest take away from my last thread: research / alloy / consumer goods jobs cost about **10 minerals per month** to your economy. that means you should prepare your economy by getting your minerals about +50/month *above* where you want them before you add 5 more specialized jobs.
* at the start of games, clear way the slum tile blocker on your homeworld for a quick extra pop.
* nutritional plenitude (a food policy choice) is excellent for almost the entire game. i like to activate it a few years into the game, immediately after i settle my first agri-world, and encourage growth on my homeworld for the first time (after first 1k food.)
* the general consensus among min/maxers is that the best opening tradition tree is expansion. you'll want to pick up the ""+10% growth"" perk as soon as possible. i usually get it third (starting with the cheaper star station costs.)
* another (strangely specific) point of consensus is that you should go down the prosperity tree *third*. this gives you some leeway to get creative. strong aggro builds go: expansion -&gt; supremacy -&gt; prosperity. more science oriented builds go expansion -&gt; discovery -&gt; prosperity. if you want to keep your leaders around, or are playing pacifistic, expansion -&gt; harmony -&gt; prosperity isn't too bad.
* although it may seem like you can't directly manage where your pops work, you definitely can: decrease the priority of your pop jobs until your pops decide to work in the desired place. pops only pick new jobs on creation, unemployment, resettlement, and by forced ousting / preference from priority management. edit: pops can move into new jobs as you re-raise priorities, thus messing up your forced plan for them. you can still mostly get what you want, though.
* avoid increasing your pop living standards until mid-late game. consumer goods are hard to produce efficiently early in the game, and you'll want to avoid needing to do so over better choices.
* you'll want to spam out ""encourage growth"" non-stop on all of your worlds until you hit the desired size (this is almost never on city worlds, but more on this later.)
* some jobs aren't very good, and it's best to permanently decrease their priority if you can. a great example is enforcer pops on worlds with a righteous governor -- you'll be able to squeeze out just that much more efficiency by turning their priority down just before adding more specialist jobs.
* there's no leader cap in stellaris anymore. feel free to spam out a bunch of early scientists, and hand-pick your scientists to roll the right techs, or give you extra % on your current ones.
* unless you want to exploit the market (i avoid exploits like the plague), you should only use the market for (basically) two reasons:
   * to fill a temporary hole in your economy while the relevant permanent fix applies (e.g. producing more minerals by swapping out energy districts for mining ones, or producing more consumer goods to match the amount you're borrowing, etc.)
   * once you hit one resource cap, and could really use a boost to another resource (for example: 10k max minerals with +100 minerals / month -&gt; sell 200 minerals a month until you drop down to 5k minerals, then cancel the trade.)
* on the first market use condition, consider getting yourself out of your economic trade deal your short-term goal. this is because, on the whole, (non-exploitative) market use is disadvantageous compared to local production. e.g. if you could turn +20 energy into +20 minerals by swapping some districts around, the market will charge you +40 energy for the same +20 minerals (the numbers aren't exact, but you get the idea.)
* the **best** early game techs are the ones that unlock the ""+15% resource"" buildings -- as these are some of the only buildings with no downsides on your rural worlds. after that, the next best thing to grab is pop growth techs / buildings.
* generally speaking, **mineral production** is super important, while **stored minerals** aren't terribly important. this is because there's only so much to spend stored minerals on, while mineral production is the standard by which you can industrialize your economy by producing more consumer goods / research / alloys.
* resettle pops to your new worlds to speed them straight to 10 pops. this is good for kick-starting worlds, and it's also great for slowing down your older rural world growth, as they'll start to hit overcrowding early if you don't.
* it's easy to forget to grow your territory with construction ships -- but unless you're gearing up for war, you should occasionally check back and do this. i personally find that it's best to have 2-3 construction ships positioned near the various borders you plan on growing out from. this means that on any one check-in with your construction ships, you can give 2-3 expansion orders instead of just 1-2.
* generally speaking, never upgrade your ships in 2.2. for some reason, the upgrade cost is ludicrously high right now, sometimes higher than just producing new ships. just keep adding fresh ships to old fleets and let battle attrition away your old designs.---

# planets:

&amp;#x200b;

the best way to think about planets (that i've found) works like this:

&amp;#x200b;

there's two basic types of planets you'll settle: **rural** planets and **city** planets.

&amp;#x200b;

your city planets are going to draw a ton of resources from your rural planets, so you'll want to aim for a ratio of about 2 rural : 1 city. it's also important to have about 3 city planets by about 2300, so this means you should aim for at least 9 planets by 2300.

&amp;#x200b;

you design rural planets to maximize raw resource extraction -- so they're best on planets with a lot of resource districts (at least as many as the size of the planet). city planets are best on large planets (size 18+), as this will give you the city districts you'll need to develop the planet past the point where you have more than enough pops for all the worker jobs on that world.

this means there's basically two orthogonal considerations on rural vs. city planets:

1. increasing size: better for city planets.
2. as many or more resource districts than the planet size: better for rural planets.

this means that occasionally, you'll find a size 20+ world that is actually better as a rural planet than a city one.

&amp;#x200b;

now, rural planets and city planets both diversify into a number of different kinds of archetype worlds:

&amp;#x200b;

\---

&amp;#x200b;

# rural planets:

# 

there's generally two things to think about rural planets:

&amp;#x200b;

a. where are all the resource districts concentrated?

b. is it a big planet?

&amp;#x200b;

let's consider a. first:

&amp;#x200b;

i like to label my planets (by putting the tag in front of their names) as follows:

&amp;#x200b;

""agri"" : food / mineral districts only. this means food districts + mineral districts is greater than or equal to planet size.

&amp;#x200b;

""gen"" : energy / mineral districts only. this means energy districts + mineral districts is greater than or equal to planet size.

&amp;#x200b;

""rural"" : the ""everything goes"" hybrid / generic rural planet. this means neither ""agri"" nor ""gen"" applies, almost always because there's not enough mineral districts on the planet for either sub-categorization condition to obtain. ""rural"" planets are almost always, therefore, running all three kinds of districts.

&amp;#x200b;

generally, the first three districts on ""agri"" / ""gen"" worlds depend on what i need in the short-term. long-term, however, you should maximize mineral districts on these worlds. ""rural"" worlds alone can afford to run fewer than max mineral districts: e.g. maximize food / energy districts, take whatever is left in mining districts.

&amp;#x200b;

\---

&amp;#x200b;

b. is it a big rural planet?

&amp;#x200b;

if so, you can usually afford to turn it into what i call ""suburb"" planets. ""suburb"" planets are those resource-focused rural planets that can support enough pops to grant you lots of building slots, but the main role of the planet is still to support your city planets. in that case, ""suburb"" planets are great for all of the following:

&amp;#x200b;

* exotic refineries to produce exotic resources to feed your city worlds.
* tier 1 alloy / consumer goods / research buildings, because your city worlds won't grow fast enough to support ***all*** your high-end resource needs (although they will still support most.)
* unity producing buildings, because these take up consumer goods that you'll usually want to ration away from smaller, non-suburb worlds.

generally, the biggest difference between smaller resource planets (rural), and larger resource planets (suburbs) will be the number of city districts you build there. rural planets should only have 1 or fewer. suburbs can have 2 or 3.

&amp;#x200b;

\---

&amp;#x200b;

# city planets

&amp;#x200b;

as with rural / resource planets, there's a lot to think about for your city planets. i usually find there to be two good designs:

&amp;#x200b;

1. ""forge"" planets: consumer goods and alloys
2. ""tech"" planets: research

&amp;#x200b;

this is usually the best way to lay out your buildings because of specialty buildings you get in the mid-game:

""ministry of production"" -- a building you get that boosts artisan (cg) and metallurgist (alloys) output by +15%. this is what makes ""forge"" worlds so good, and why -- because forge worlds are usually inadequate at providing ***all*** your consumer goods / alloys needs -- suburb worlds (mentioned earlier) can pick up the slack with some tier 1 consumer goods and alloys.

&amp;#x200b;

""research institute"" -- a building that boosts researcher output by +15%, in addition to a science director job, which is quite potent. this is what makes ""tech"" worlds so good -- they can stack an enormous amount of tech points on a single planet, with bonuses like a high level scientist assisting research + the research institute.

&amp;#x200b;

\---

&amp;#x200b;

a few other tips:

&amp;#x200b;

* generally speaking, i put gene clinics on my suburb worlds and my city worlds, but only upgrade them to cyto-revitalization centers on city worlds. similarly for unity buildings -- it's best to only place them on suburb / city worlds, and only upgrade them on city worlds.
* resource districts will eventually become obsolete on your city worlds -- there will be so many specialist jobs, every single pop will be a specialist."
603,"thats it. fixed it only being one planet with 16 slots, now its 25 slots + 2 other gaias. sigh. 99 little bugs in the code. take one down, patch it around, 117 little bugs in the code
"
604,"hi, guys! wouldyou think, that there is lack of process of single currency creation? like, firstly every civilization has it's own currency and they can only do some natural trade between each other, but later they create the single currency (credits), and there are some bonuses for the initiator. doesn't it make more sense? 

&amp;#x200b;"
605,"mineral supply is the key from middle game on. you need them for everything and you may face shortage of you don't manage the empire very well. 

so now you have a dlc to solve this. yes, vanilla is kind of limited from mid game. with megacorp you have matter decompressor and ecumenopoli. the later allows you to make alloys and consumer goods without rare resources  (which means less minerals in turn).

in my opinion this is essential for every game and makes vanilla vs megacorp a total different game. 

mineral production should be buffed either by tech or tiles... and, why the hell a city planet can build things without basic materials? "
606,"i see a lot of people asking for help managing their economy so i figured i'd create this guide with some of my thoughts.  if you like this, i also wrote up a quickstart guide for [your first 25 game years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/a40wxk/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_guide_for_first_25/)

i believe there are two easy methods for conceptualizing how to manage your economy.  you can think of your economy like a black box with inputs/outputs.  inputs are the base resources: food/minerals/energy.  outputs are things that drive your empire forward: research/unity/ships (alloys).  you can either look at improving your inputs and figure out how to spend them to produce outputs (bottom-up approach) or you can look at your outputs and pick one to improve production of somehow (top-down approach).

# bottom up

in the early game, you are usually in bottom-up mode.  you look for planets/systems with good raw resource production and spend whatever excess you have on outputs.  you look at whichever raw resource income is the worst and work on fixing that by building districts/stations to harvest it.   occasionally when you have excess of something you build a building that consumes it to get rid of the excess.  this is fine, but you are basically just moving from solving one crisis to the next as your economy shifts from producing an excess/deficit of one raw resource to the next.  **you are cramming as many inputs as you can into the black box and hoping it produces some useful outputs.**

this isn't a bad way to play, but it lacks planning and efficiency.  you are living in the now rather than planning for the future.  

# top down

at some point after the early game, you need to shift to the top-down approach.  this is where you pick some output of your empire (research/unity/alloys) and work on supporting and improving it.  for example, lets say you have the option to upgrade a research lab.  before you do this, you need to ensure that you can actually support it.  do you have enough food to feed the lab technicians?  can you support the increased consumer goods needs?  do you have enough income of the required strategic resource to spare?   do you have new pops to work these jobs or will your farmers promote themselves and cause starvation?  

these problems must be fixed before you even think about upgrading the building.  you need to try and visualize how this upgrade will effect your current economy and have a good idea what it will cost you.  if you just upgrade and build with no consideration for the effects (upkeep/pop promotion/trade-offs) then your economy will spiral into chaos.  **your desired outputs require certain inputs.**

admittedly, this approach is more difficult.  it requires more game knowledge and future planning to pull off, but the more you play, the more you should find yourself using the top down approach instead of bottom up.

# damage control

you can plan things all you want, but sometimes shit happens that throws everything into turmoil.  it could be a weird event, marauders, a crisis, or a war declaration by another empire.  there are some things you just can't predict.  if you find yourself with multiple negative incomes and rapidly declining stockpiles, you need to go into damage control mode.  your economy has sprung a leak and needs to be fixed.  how do we fix leaks?  we shut off some valves.  in this case, we need to shut off the output valves (research/unity/alloys).  

start by disabling buildings that consume the resources you are running out of (or de-prioritize the jobs).  for example, if you are running out of consumer goods, shut down research labs.  if you are running out of minerals, shut down alloy foundries (not civilian industries, unless you also have excess consumer goods to handle the shutdown).  if you are running out of energy, sell resources you have excess of, starting with alloys and excess strategic resources (worth the most and not needed to keep your economy afloat).  if possible, pause the game while you do this (keep in mind the monthly numbers won't update until the next month).  avoid shutting down things that increase happiness/amenities/reduce crime (unless you have a lot of excess).  unhappy pops produce less which can cause you to spiral out of control.

once you have stopped the leak, you need to work on plugging it.  improve the production of whatever resources you lack by shifting pop jobs or creating new jobs (thru districts/buildings) that produce what you need.  also be careful not to construct anything that will cause further drain on that resource.  once the crisis is averted you can shift back to top-down/bottom-up management.

607,i've noticed a few empires change symbols and colours after loading a save. it doesn't happen every time but once they've changed they're that colour forever (or until it hits them again but i haven't seen it happen twice).
608,"leading the axis of unaligned powers in the war in heaven led to a couple issues. 

the first and largest issue, was that when i was able to take over all the worlds of one of the fallen empires, their empire fell apart and all of their vassals were freed, but my war with them didn't end. i was stuck in a war with all of their vassals and i couldn't gain progress so my only options were to stay at war with them or surrender. the war screen was bugged in that it showed the federation symbol next to all of the ex-vassal empires and hovering over it said something like ""member of"" and then nothing. 

the next issue had to do with federation fleet. since i was the president, i had control of the fleet which was pretty cool. it was exciting to see the other members building ships that would come and join the fleet automatically. at least it was until their auto pathing kept taking them through enemy systems to reach me. the ai were building tons of corvettes that would easily die to starbases. this would cause that corvette to then be considered a separate fleet. 

my fleet manager became utterly bloated with tons and tons of dead, single corvette fleets. the process to remove a fleet was to click intensive and time consuming for just how many fleets their were. so i had to just let it keep stacking up.

maybe there is something i'm missing, but if anyone has any fixes for these, that'd be great. otherwise i think i should post this over on the paradox forum as well."
609,"hey! i haven’t played the game for a year and i was wondering how it is now since i’m on summer vacations. is it still a fun and interesting way to build a interstellar empire?

i always thought the middle to end game to be quite boring and never quite understood how to build a proper military. is there any tutorial or post about this subjects after the big updates that the game received?"
610,"ever since 2.2, it doesn't seem to matter what i do, and within 100 years of game start, with the exception of fallen empires, everyone else is inferior or pathetic when it comes to fleet size. is this a known issue? "
611,"1. planetary bombardment causes devastation to tick upwards, but ground assaults don't. this makes ""army collateral damage +33%"" from the ""butcher"" trait meaningless. is this a bug?   
2. devastation decreases even after occupation. on one hand, this makes it easier for empires to recover from devastation, but on the other, in a long war, bombardment becomes nonviable. i dunno, it feels like an oversight to me."
612,"i've played couple of games and the time you wait for all our fleet to be upgraded gets ridiculously long, especially in mid-late game. there is no mod compatible that would change that but you can easily modify this yourself:

&amp;#x200b;

1. go to \\steamlibrary\\steamapps\\common\\stellaris\\common\\defines\\00\_defines.txt
2. search for fleet\_upgrade\_time\_cost\_mult
3. change from 0.75 to 0.25
4. if you find it too fast, play around with the number to find sweet spot that works for you.

save game compatible, although i would advise against using it while upgrade is underway.

have fun!"

you need to make a copy of the spreadsheet, as you are supposed to modify parts of it.

simply fill in planet size and district slots on the top then min/max the building/sector list on the left to your hearts desire. resources are displayed on the right with deficits turning red and surpluses being green.

does not fully reflect gestalt, hivemind or megacorp empires as of now and also does not 100% represent spiritualist or mechanical empires, although it mostly works for them due to only roboticist and priest jobs being not shown. i will be working on other spreadsheets to reflect them. (apologies but adding in multiple capital building systems or random jobs that only apply sometimes is beyond my skills atm)

if you see a building that is not included, please send me a picture of the building and worker's tool-tip, as the wiki is not fully updated and i believe i am missing a few upgrades/buildings/jobs themselves.

bug reports are welcome.

614,"as the issues surrounding game performance are on the top again i decided to spend some productive time during hangover and did this:

[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/multithreading-in-stellaris-a-quick-performance-analysis.1138327/](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/multithreading-in-stellaris-a-quick-performance-analysis.1138327/)

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr: it doesn't seem the issue is with lack of multithreading as much as stuffing the serialized parts into same thread that does the rendering. ""how hard can it be"" to fix."
615,"they are pretty damn annoying. especially as starting neighbours.

616,the fleet is around 100 ships and most are already up to date and upgrades. any news if this is going to change? it would be much more efficient just to suicide my old fleet and build a whole new one. thanks!
617,"so with the new patch i was playing my usual commonwealth game when i met some stupid alpine hamsters who promptly picked a fight with me. our tiny, 2230 fleets duked it out for awhile, but i won and took 5 planets from him, including his homeworld. now, i barely had enough human pops for my own planets, so i spent the next 60 odd years trying to get some enforcers over there while still maintianing my economy. it wasn't until i could change the habitability of my humans, around 2300, that the planets actually became useful. 

my question is, do you guys think it would have been better just to make a vassal out of those planets, after dropping some humans in to keep order? "
618,"if you have lots of planets you rarely remember them all by name. there will always be less sectors than planets making them easier to remember.

something like this:
""refugees arrived on mitakul in frontier sector"""
619,"i was playing as the united nations of earth and i decided to free the slaves in a tiny nation that only had one system. i killed off their star base and took over the planet. the country was ruled by the species shown and they had several of the birds in space suits as their slaves, but once i looked at the captured planet only the birds in space suits remained and the founder species was absolutely no where in the galaxy. i am still very confused how this happened mainly because all of the ruler strata on the planet were fully empty. if this is actually a feature in the game, what happened?"
620,300 years in and the strongest ai fleet other than the fallen empires is ~10k. seems ridiculously low.
621,"i started as a spiritualist, fanatic xenophile megacorp and i'm surrounded by a lot of friends through the power of bribery. i also found and claimed the first league ecumenopolis. having ran out of systems to survey, i ordered my swarm of scientists to go back and forth between two black hole systems and lo and behold the worm has heard my prayers... long story short, now i have 11 empty tomb worlds in my home system, 6 of them size 20 or above, waiting to be colonized. 

&amp;#x200b;

however, when i say empty, i mean it. they have 0 generator, mining or agri district slots, and no special resources either. i already have the league ecumenopolis and i was hoping these would be mining worlds to feed that... how do i put them to productive use? just stuff them full of city districts and clerks, or make them ecumenopolises themselves? i require more minerals or at least money to buy it."
622,"my wife has been playing stellaris for the first time and has hit an issue - resource income will be fine, then suddenly plummet into the negative. when checking into why this might have happened, hovering over a planet's production/consumption statistics i see that every resource has a malus, flagged as 'empire:'... -50% food, -40% minerals, -40% energy, etc., etc.

looking in the government tab reveals nothing that should be giving that sized penalty on an empire-wide level; the only empire wide modifiers are market nexus and drone mining techniques.

is this a bug, or is there something i'm not aware of? shouldn't any 'empire' based maluses be visible from the empire screen? am i going nuts?"
623,like i'll randomly go from +14 energy per month and -16 food per month to -13 energy and +29 food. wtf? this keeps happening.

626,"here is how it generally goes for me:

inspiration strikes. i create a new empire. aggressive, brutish, unrelenting slavers. barbaric despoilers that will take aliens and force them into servitude.

i start the game and begin expanding just enough, i think, to get a fleet going to ravage the galaxy. i meet my nearest neighbours and they seem soft - ripe for the taking.

years pass and my capital is flourishing into a futuristic utopia. against all my intentions, my resources seem to be getting spent improving the lives of my people. rather than creating alloys my minerals are destined to become consumer goods. the next building slot is allocated for a forge, i think, but it inevitably ends up as a noble estate producing amenities.

the aliens that i encountered decades ago, at first terrified by the promises of war and slaughter that i offered on first contact, actually come to realise that the barbarians at the gates aren't all that bad. once you get to know them and all.

i need help understanding how to actually play something aggressive. the moment for despoilation just never seems to arrive for me. can anyone offer a useful guide to at least opening the game aggressively?"
627,"this is something that i noticed in my current game and i'm not sure wheather this is a bug or feature. i am running reasonably open empire. no xenophile ethos, but xenophile faction is happy as can be and i took some migrants in. so many that my starting species became a minority (as an aside, i think that the way system choosing the pop to grow needs some tweaks, because favouring minorities leads to weird results). so most of the leaders i can recruit are from one of other species living in my borders.

  
that wouldn't be a problem if the leader elections allowed anyone but my starters. it came to a situation that i only have one candidate to choose from, due to the fact that they are the only leader from the species. i am pretty much done with that specific run, but it was little annoying and i feared i would end up with no valid candidate.  


i even checked the speices rights to see if there's an option for that, but didn't find anything that looked like it.  
"
628,"is it considered a ""feature"" for your droid workers to go from their worker jobs and take over specialist jobs, causing mass unemployment and a food shortage? i tried shuffling around priorities but this doesn't work.

why doesn't it just automatically promote robots only when jobs aren't filled, instead of taking away jobs? or better yet, why can't i decide who does what job?

does anyone know of a workaround? the only thing i've come up with is just mass resettling enough workers to this planet while i wait for the specialists to demote.

i've found this to be a very game breaking bug, and now i have a crime increase thanks to the unemployment.

tl;dr: don't get the droid worker tech, it will mass unemploy your specialists and starve you of whatever worker resource they were gathering."

this should not be rng, but a guaranteed option tech the moment you have a planet or system that contains such a resource. or at least make it some special project or *something*, science ship to ""extract samples"" for research to unlock the option.

even better than you can't buy the damn shit off the market unless you have some either. i have shit tons of motes spawned around me, but the only gas i found is about 20 systems away on the other side of another empire in the way.

633,"in my current game i have a criminal syndicate as my neighbour. me, being the local authoritarian military bully, decided to wage war to oust their outposts on my planets. however, after the five year truce is up they just happily replant their criminal branches on my planets. rinse and repeat for 4 times and i'm tired of waging war against them, so i decide to vassalize them as they have a good portion of useless land. to my surprise however they keep their branch offices as my vassal, and i am unable to expel them unless i want to sit through 10+ years of crime and corruption to integrate them."
634,"so i'm testing out the newly buffed synthetic asencion in the 2.2 beta patch. i took a close look at my robots and synth before ascending. a big upside is that they only require half housing, a small energy upkeep and no consumer goods (or very low, i can't remember). 
         
however, as soon as you either change citizen rights of synths from servitude to full citizen rights, or you choose the synthetic ascencion project (which will give them full citizen rights, since they are your main species) your empire economy will crash.       
      
before 2.2, synthetic ascencion would turn all your food production buildings into power plants. this is no longer the case. all your farming districts will stay farming districts and be useless. your maximum energy districts will stay the same, so even if you would destroy your farming districts, there is no guarantee you can replace them with the same amount of energy districts.      
amenity usage will increase a ton, forcing you to create extra buildings. all your robots will require double the housing. i was going into -18 housing slots on some of my planets and crime spiked instantly and created huge problems.      
     
synths get a 10% bonus to ressource production (down from 20% before 2.2) and if you choose synthetic ascencion you gain another 10% and +1 robot modification point. you can still choose to robomod them, but with the new growth system, this will turn into micromanagement hell. you do have the option to grow specifically min/maxed robots for each job. however to do so, you have to keep checking what type of robot grows and what jobs need to be filled. before 2.2, you simply had to build a robot pop on the specific building tyle, be it unity, research, energy or minerals and then you were done with it. i had 3 types of robots: 1 for unity and energy, one for science and one for minerals. this was so much easier to micromanage.     
      
in my opinion, the synth ascencion is garbage now unless you put in a ton of work to prepare your empire beforehand. you are better off choosing either only the flesh is weak to prevent ai rebellion, use synths as enslaved or something else entirely. i had a ton of fun with synth ascencion before 2.2 but the way it works now is simply awful. i feel like the new growth system makes it way too hard to micromanage your min/maxed pops so you can maximum value out of their traits. i am incredibly dissapointed.      
     
did i miss something guys? i am concerned the new growth system made micromanagement for min/maxing traits and job a hell for not only robots, but also biological ascention.     "
635,"out of all the terrible bugs in 2.2, the market duplication exploit, the trade bug, and all the other gamebreaking glitches... i think i've found by far the worst...

[i mean... how am i supposed to play with this?!](https://i.redd.it/v1930xiehc421.png)"
636,"unless absolutely everyone hates you, you will always get better prices (and more direct conversions, such as from rare crystals to alloys directly) from other empires, including friendly fallen empires.

the only upsides the galactic market has over direct trading is that it takes fewer clicks and is less constrained in quantities (and even that is questionable, considering the huge price spike caused by one max quantity click).

so in short : only use the galactic market if nobody wants to trade with you or you've bought up all their reserves already.

ps: this stands true for the opt-in beta only. the current live patch galactic market is broken and can be easily exploited (don't do it, it really ruins the fun).

ps2: the ai will buy heaps and heaps of your excess strategic ressources, even if they can't do anything with them, like dark matter."
637,"i've been engaging with the underground civilization and have accepted one of their refugees. now, about 50 years in, every time one of their pops get generated on one of my worlds that pop is automatically assigned to the ""ruler"" stratum, meaning i typically have to wait the full 3600 days until the demote to worker, as unsurprisingly, all the ruler slots are taken on my planets. is anybody else seeing this bug?

&amp;#x200b;

edit: this is actually happening with lots of species now, though never my main species."
638,so i was playing as a biological authoritarian empire and researched dangerous technology jump drives. a bunch of events triggered and i got the tears of an ai event where half my planets were taken over by determined exterminators. i had the option of continuing to play as my original empire and fight the ais or play as the newly formed determined exterminators. i chose the exterminators. i was given a few large fleets which used about 500naval capacity. everything was fine for a few years and my naval capacity equaled this amount. all of a sudden however my naval capacity dropped to about 150. now i’m unable to maintain this fleet anymore as alloys are about -400. anyone had this experience before?
639,"hi guys, i’m looking for some help. 

my empire is very tall and spread over 11 planets. i have 500 population and it grows very quickly. i have no room for people anymore and no planets to put them on. 

any way to slow down the growth? 

i can’t give them all jobs or housing."

[high quality minerals, just not a lot of them.](https://i.redd.it/pdxudxnehb421.png)

so, i started a new empire, i built myself a lot of early science ships and went found myself a planet with the high quality minerals modifier. hooray i think, untill i see how many mineral districts i can build on it."
641,"any tips please, my main planet is maxed on energy districts and is still running a deficit. its hard being a robot!"
642,"before 2.2, there was no reason to leave unclaimed space - plop that starbase everywhere! in le guin, unless you have big amounts of admin capacity, you really have to justify the system's cost before claiming it. meaning there's just empty unclaimed space there. 

it felt even more wrong to dismantle those stations after a containment war against a determined exterminator, as i had no admin cap to spare for all that juicy territory i've got.

it just feels that gaining territory is not worth at some point, unless that territory can outweigh the admin cap effects. i feel like claimed systems should take up less admin cap, thoughts? "
643,"love the new expansion, but i can't help but feel like this is an oversight. currently it seems like habitability is pretty meaningless because +3 base pop growth for settling a world is a large bonus and the drawbacks of increased amenities and consumer goods can be circumvented by just resettling pops off world once you've built a planetary administration to get rid of the new colony growth malice."

sup, been playing stellaris for a couple years now. recently the game has been gong from 9-20 fps ever since around 2050. i also run 2-3 days behind everyone else during multiplayer. i have tried using different internet connections and firewall is disabled while i play.

648,"some notes:
multiplayer game where i am not the host.

three species, with two being enslaved and the third being human.

i recently abolished the caste system for humans only; they have full citizenship and living conditions. despite this, many of the human workers remained enslaved and any new born human pops are automatically enslaved too. this is despite there being tons of specialist slots open for them to choose, and results in tons of unemployment as none of the new born humans can become specialists.

the real kicker is that on my outer colonies, human pops are born free, even if there is no specialist jobs available (this should be the case on core worlds anyways). so i end up resettling slave humans from the core worlds to colonies and free humans to work as specialists in the core worlds.

i am 99% sure this is a bug, as it seems really inconsistent. am i missing something here? "
649,"about four months ago, i posted a similar topic.   

however, with 2.2 and megacorp, some of the preset empires have been re-tooled [chinorr stellar union is now the chinnor combine], we have a bunch of new ones [kilik cooperative, the criminal syndicate one, another megacorp, orbis [forget the full name - is it customer synergies?], and a holy tribunal one].   and the iferyx amalgamted fleets have disappeared now.  

with the current array of presets, then, let us revisit the question for 2.2/megacorp? 

which preset empire has the strongest build? the weakest build?  "
650,"they look like normal planets. bombarding them doesn't do anything. i had to invade them with a single army to flip them back.

also they still had pops from the old empire growing on them, and were still considered in the previous empire's space? i don't get it!"

652,"i've unlocked genetic modification and made different classes for different habitats. while changing one world (that isn't my capital), my rulers species-class changed to that. i can change that planets overall species-class however i like and my rulers will change to that, the problem is that this species-class is set for an arctic world with harsh conditions. i've made a species-class that would fit a ruler but can't figure out if i can change his alone. is there any way to do this?


i should add that i'm in an imperial civ and that this is my original ruler. it doesn't make sense to me why he would change with a world that isn't my capital, but apparently it's a thing. "
653,"it makes the playthrough i'm on feel unplayable. even if i win i have to rebuild literally every building because it instantly destroys the infrastructure on half of your planets.

&amp;#x200b;

edit: i think this could be fixed by changing the way the mechanic worked. i think it would make the most sense and still be challenging if they made it so one of your systems fell to the machine empire. they can spawn with a stupid big fleet, i'm okay with that, but the way it currently work just fucks you over for 10 years whether you win it or not. it's at the point where i just never want to tech sapient combat ai ever."

cheers!"
659,"i am growing very frustrated at some of the stupid things that this game throw at you. one of the most annoying one i've noticed recently is that fleets just don't stay at any range but point blank.

in a recent game against the unbidden, my plan was to use long range artillery battleships and titans to avoid the death zone near their ship where most of their damage is done. and while it worked much more than corvette spam, i've lost dozens of battleships and 3 titans just because my fleet commander somehow can't hold himself from ramming the enemy, nullifying the very obvious advantages he had in and disregarding the guidelines of the artillery computer. 

is there anything i can do to avoid losing ship after ship to this besides bringing even bigger fleets to kill the enemy fast enough?"

661,"some recent posts have gotten me thinking about what playing tall/wide represents story wise and what they might mean for game play strategy. note that this doesn't necessarily represent how they function in the current game. rather, i'm trying to start from the beginning as to what the game-play intent and story intent should be that drives the design decisions of the game. i'm making no attempt to figure out the exact details and numbers of the system that would balance these things. i know there are a million different ways you can imagine these things up, but below is just one way that i imagined game play styles. feel free to like some ideas i'm putting out and dislike others. i assumed that there is a cap on how high the levels of food production can go in the galaxy. this means that there is essentially a galactic population cap. feel free to throw additional ideas in the comments.

# tall and wide alliances

**wide trading empires**

*basic idea*

this is an empire that focuses on colonizing as much of the galaxy as possible to support its growing populations.

&amp;#x200b;

*game play style*

early game: wide empires focus on exploration to identify colony expansion targets and trading partners. they also begin specializing their technology and traditions for expansion.

mid game: a wide empire begins its expansion. in return for its investment into expansion a wide empires main strength is its access to raw resources through its occupation of large areas of the galaxy. capital investment will be simple and planets will only be lightly built up due to the spread of their population. because of the simple infrastructure colonization would depend mostly on raw resources such as minerals and energy. since each colony delivers more raw resources colonization would grow exponentially until the empire runs out of room. while wide empires will have a lot of raw resources they will not have developed manufacturing and technology infrastructure. therefore they will need to develop trade allies with tall empires to acquire the goods they need to defend themselves.

late game: once a wide empire runs out of area to expand it must transition to a balanced economy. however, doing so will cause drastic political turmoil with the tall empires. in the very late game population growth will stagnate due to very large amounts of starvation. this will have multiple effects. first of all it will cause high levels of unrest in the empire, increasing the risk of revolts. second it will cause high levels of attraction to xenophobe ethics. indiscriminate bombardments and purging become more common tactics. finally, it will make it more likely that lower food consumption, slower reproduction, or shorter lifespans will evolve in the population. if an empire manages to balance out their reproduction through evolution and/or gene modding they may become stagnant empires.

**tall trading empires**

*basic idea*

this is an empire that focuses on building up its planets into great cities to support growing populations.

&amp;#x200b;

*game play style*

early game: tall empires will focus on exploration to identify trading partners and increase their scientific knowledge. they also begin specializing their technology and traditions for manufacturing and tech.

mid game: tall empires will develop massive metropolises on a small number of planets. due to limited raw resources on each planet these cities will have many jobs focused towards technology research and turning raw resources in to more complex products. since research rates are heavily dependent on technology, research rates will increase exponentially. however, all of these jobs will not be able to be supported from the limited raw resources on their planets. therefore tall empires will need to develop trade allies with wide empires for raw resources. the wide empire will provide the tall empire with raw resources and in return the tall empire will supply the wide empire with advanced products.

late game: once a tall empire runs out of area to expand into it will begin to focus even more on technology to increase the efficiency of its raw resource collection. however this will only get a tall empire so far. at that point two things can happen. first, if a wide empire can be convinced, it could join it in a federation and negotiate continued economic cooperation. it could then work to grow their power over the rest of the empires in the galaxy. over time the tall empire would dominate the wide empire since the tall empire would continue to expand technologically while the wide empire could not continue to to colonize. if the wide empire chooses to begin transitioning to a more balanced economy or if the tall empire does not wish to form a permanent federation with the wide empire, then war is unavoidable as the tall empire does not have access to the raw resources it needs within its own borders. such a situation would put both empires in an extremely vulnerable situation until a victor is determined. the wide empire would face a lack of advanced goods from the tall empire while it transitions its economy. it would therefore have to rely on large unsophisticated fleets to defend itself during the transition. the tall empire would face a lack of raw resources, including food, until it was able to conquer enough territory from the wide empires. it would rely on high tech ships to defend itself. while the wide empire would struggle to defend its large area, a slip-up by the tall empire leading to the loss of a single planet could be catastrophic. in the very late game population growth will stagnate due to very large amounts of starvation. this will have multiple effects. first of all it will cause high levels of unrest in the empire, increasing the risk of revolts. second it will cause high levels of attraction to xenophobe ethics. indiscriminate bombardments and purging become more common tactics. finally, it will make it more likely that lower food consumption, slower reproduction, or shorter lifespans will evolve in the population. if an empire manages to balance out their reproduction through evolution and/or gene modding they may become stagnant empires.

**summary**

wide empires have big galactic footprints with low population density. tall empires have small galactic footprints with high population density. the two must form a symbiotic relationship with the wide empire supplying the alliance with raw resources and the tall empire supplying the alliance with advanced products. once the galactic market is formed alliances between tall and wide empires may become less formal, but they must still exist. furthermore there must be a balance of how many tall and wide empires there are in the galaxy. if there are more of one than the other then some empires will have to transition in order to not be dominated. in the end game wide empires must attempt to transition to balanced empires or face being dominated by the tall empires. this will cause conflict with the tall empires. wide empires should band together with wide empires to revolt and tall empires should band with tall empires to suppress the wide empires. this conflict may be full of political intrigue and treachery. the resulting winners will either transition to balanced empires or form alliances of tall empires who dominate wide empire vassals.

&amp;#x200b;

# balanced empires

**balanced trading empires**

*basic idea*

balanced empires are self contained. they produce all goods that they require.

&amp;#x200b;

*game play style*

early game: balanced empires will focus on exploration to identify colony expansion targets, neighboring allies, and to increase their scientific knowledge.

mid game: balanced empires will develop metropolises on a small number of planets. due to limited raw resources on each planet these cities will have many jobs focused towards technology research and turning raw resources in to more complex products. however, all of these jobs will not be able to be supported from the limited raw resources on these planets. therefore balanced empires will need to develop fringe worlds which will send raw resources back to the main colonies. since a balanced empire is not focused specifically on technology it will lag behind tall and wide allied groups. to make up for this balanced empires should enter into research pacts with other balanced empires or trusting tall and wide groups.

late game: once a balanced empire runs out of room to expand it has two options. first it could create a federation with other balanced empires. this could include joining federations of tall and wide pairs. alternatively it can begin aggression to expand its influence in the galaxy. in the very late game population growth will stagnate due to very large amounts of starvation. this will have multiple effects. first of all it will cause high levels of unrest in the empire, increasing the risk of revolts. second it will cause high levels of attraction to xenophobe ethics. indiscriminate bombardments and purging become more common tactics. finally, it will make it more likely that lower food consumption, slower reproduction, or shorter lifespans will evolve in the population. if an empire manages to balance out their reproduction through evolution and/or gene modding they may become stagnant empires.

**balanced tall tech empires**

*basic idea*

this is an empire that focuses on building up its planets into great cities to support growing populations. the tall tech empire is dedicated to advancement of technology at the neglect of family and reproduction. this is due to either a genetic trait or a deeply ingrained culture.

&amp;#x200b;

*game play style*

early game: tall tech empires will focus on exploration to increase their scientific knowledge. they also begin specializing their technology and traditions for manufacturing and tech.

mid game: tall tech empires will develop metropolises on a tiny number of planets. due to limited raw resources on each planet these cities will have many jobs focused towards technology research and turning raw resources in to more complex products. since research rates are heavily dependent on technology, research rates will increase exponentially. a tall tech empire will dedicate even more effort towards technological advancement making them much more advanced than even a standard tall empire. however, these results are at the cost of family and community, leading to lower birthrates and populations. despite this the advanced technology of such an empire allows for the empire to have somewhat competitive levels of production as other empires with less raw resources and population. they can be aggressive, independently passive, or they can join up with other empires and groups if the galaxy starts to form alliances.

late game: once a tall tech empire runs out of room to expand it has two options. first it could create a federation with other balanced empires. this could include joining federations of tall and wide pairs. alternatively it can begin aggression to expand its influence in the galaxy. in the very late game tech empires have the disadvantage of not having as big of a population, which becomes an issue as other empires catch up in technology. however, they have the advantage of being more unified and stable due to not having much of an issue with starvation. often that the larger empires of the galaxy will break into chaos around them and they will emerge as dominant leaders at that point. tech empires that survive long enough turn into stagnant empires eventually as they reach an equilibrium in population and a peak in technology.

**balanced aggressive isolationist empires**

*basic idea*

balanced empires are self contained. they produce all goods that they require.

&amp;#x200b;

*game play style*

early game: balanced empires will focus on exploration to identify colony expansion targets, neighboring rivals, and to increase their scientific knowledge.

mid game: balanced empires will develop metropolises on a small number of planets. due to limited raw resources on each planet these cities will have many jobs focused towards technology research and turning raw resources in to more complex products. however, all of these jobs will not be able to be supported from the limited raw resources on these planets. therefore balanced empires will need to develop fringe worlds which will send raw resources back to the main colonies. since a balanced empire is not focused specifically on technology it will lag behind tall and wide allied groups. to make up for this an aggressive isolationist empire will have to find opportunities to conquer systems from rivals.

late game: to stay relevant in the late game aggressive isolationist empires must become the largest empires in the galaxy by late game. those who do not must either compromise and form temporary pacts with other isolationist empires or perish. large aggressive isolationist empires can attempt to conquer the rest of the galaxy. smaller ones who are forced to form temporary pacts can work together to conquer and grow. once they've become dominant forces in the galaxy war is inevitable between the two. if an imbalance between the two develops before this point war is inevitable and both may perish. in the very late game population growth will stagnate due to very large amounts of starvation. this will have multiple effects. first of all it will cause high levels of unrest in the empire, increasing the risk of revolts. second it will cause high levels of attraction to xenophobe ethics. indiscriminate bombardments and purging become more common tactics. finally, it will make it more likely that lower food consumption, slower reproduction, or shorter lifespans will evolve in the population. if an empire manages to balance out their reproduction through evolution and/or gene modding they may become stagnant empires."
662,my pokey 130-200 fleet power just sits around doing nothing for the first hour or so of a game.  is there some way i can utilize this thing effectively?
663,"just what it says in the title, really. if for whatever reason you happen to come into possession of an inhabited planet you don't want (small size, nasty planetary modifiers, you want to play tall and don't need the extra planet), can you pack up the colony and dismantle everything?

i know you could just release a vassal instead, but screw that. just because i don't want to use it doesn't mean i want anyone else to get to live there either."
664,"after recent (beta) patch all galactic trade is now fixed and unmoving. no matter how much you sell or buy. i can't express how incredibly lame this is. instead of lively economy where you  keep an eye on good deals, you get boring ass design back. might as well go back to trading with other empires. all to fix stupid exploit bug  that 98% of us don't care because we don't play stupid multiplayer... thinking of reverting back to 2.2.1"
665,"i've experienced this problem and the only streamer i watch, on the first day i found him, had this problem. wondering if it is a big deal with anyone else and if there are plans to fix.

basically, if you go to war with another empire and they have a defensive alliance or federation, you have to deal with all federation or defensive allies. even if they are blocked by a neutral empire and contribute nothing to the war. this effectively makes subjugation casus bellis null in my experience. there needs to be mechanics in game  that determine contribution between different empires, i think, so the ai can't protect each other from across the map in places the attacker cant reasonably reach. 

does the community have any input on this issue?"
666,"le new colony: 2 specialists (colonists) and all workers.

really?"
667,"did other people notice migation seem to ignore habitability, leading to migration treaties being a big liability because immigrant pops could come to planets where they require prohibitive amounts of amenities and consumer goods?

i was attempting to play with free haven, but this is putting a damper on this quite a bit. what's your thoughts?"
668,"so i've been trying (key word) to play since the 2.2 update came out, and i've been failing miserably. in the best of times, my economy is in shambles due to lack of energy, my research is falling behind because i'm forced to focus on energy production, and all sorts of other problems. most recently after finally starting a game where i managed to (sort of) keep my energy production positive, i finally started mining some volatile motes (research is still lagging because of forced energy focus) and upgraded my alloy foundries. however, despite the fact that i have 4 motes of income, and my planet is only consuming 2 (my empire is getting +2 motes a turn) my capitol is claiming is has -1 motes, and it's destroying my economy. i don't understand why my planet is not getting the motes despite having stations built on them. i have no piracy, and i haven't even ever seen piracy in the new update.

i'm getting the same thing with a lot of other basic production. i have to completely kill and specialization i could hope for because i have to get those 4 extra minerals so i'm not negative and destroy my economy. why can't i trade resources in from my stations to support the planet? is there something glaringly obvious i'm missing? it took me 10 hours of play on the new update to even figure out i can manually control the jobs for my pops, which i what helped my energy issues but i still can't focus on anything due to having to prevent my economy from collapsing."
669,"(reposted from the pdx forums)

i've noticed a number of people, in the various threads about reactions to 2.2, citing the opinions of their friend groups. these tend very much towards a consensus of either resounding applause or bitter resentment. this was something i observed on a wider scale with 2.0.

of my group, everyone seems thrilled and one buddy of mine has finally taken an interest in stellaris, a game he previously refused to touch. we're pretty casual players; even my friend who can't play eu iv without cheating like mad is in love with the new economy system despite the wonky balance and bugs.

what are the thoughts of your beloved nerdy gamer friends? "
670,"i've just reached endgame years in 2400 and i have the most powerful fleet at 25k that should grow as time goes on and i upgrade. i don't see how people can survive the crisis (if it hasn't changed from the 120k fleets it drops from before 2.2) much less beat fallen empires before 2500.

671,"with wiz gone from stellaris, what's the likelihood we still get our space unicorns?"
672,"i've recently gotten back into the game. i have never used mods, and currently have the new update 2.2. 

that being said i am pretty confused about some of my building options. i can make some buildings that have a description as to what they are. but, they have no description of how they benefit my planet. i also have some buildings with names that look like code in a way. for example tech_show and capital_building_one.

am i missing something? or do i have a corupt game file? i have been watching people play on youtube and it doesnt look like they have the same options. "

&amp;#x200b;

the space goblins mafia rose to power, explored space and met some aliens. some mushroom slavers to the north, lizard people to the northwest who hates the goblins for no reason, fanatical purifier elves to the south.

i don't blame the elves, if their first alien encounter are these repugnant goblins, of course they'd be horrified and decided to be fanatical purifiers.

well you see, in addition to being a criminal syndicate, the goblins also took indentured assets, nihilistic acquisition and later xeno-compatibility.

they'd come to your planet, kidnap your population into slavery, and force them to make half-goblin half-breeds.

&amp;#x200b;

goblin slayer intensifies.

&amp;#x200b;

so of course the elves hate the goblins, but you know what's the best part? the elves are fanatical purifiers. no one cares what the goblins will do to them.

the first century came and went. the goblins set up drug labs everywhere, then resold excess consumer goods on the galactic market for some extra profit.

cheap narcotics for everyone. you xenos can stay home and be high as a kite and not even bother having to wear pants!

the mushroom slavers got along well with the goblins because they can hang out and talk about all day.

the lizard people hated the mushrooms and the goblins, kept yammering something about democracy and sapiens-rights. however, since they are the center of drug trade, basically a distributor of goblin products, so the goblins tolerated them and think that they are just high or something.

the fanatical purifier elves for the short end of the stick. they were repeated raided by the goblins to be used as slaves. got to show my mushroom friends my new xeno slaves. later after xeno-compatibility, the elves became something more, and no one bats an eye because they are fanatical purifiers.

they have their reasons to hate xenos.

after a few repeated raids, the elves were so weakened, that some opportunist horse people conquered them and put them out of their misery. ironically, some elves refugees decided to flee to the goblins.

the goblins welcomed all refugees, for a price that they are willing to loan, on the condition that they'd have to work off their debt.

and so ends the first century.

the goblins have secured their position in the galaxy as the exclusive drug cartel,major economic powerhouse, indentured assets owner, and featuring xeno-compatibility pleasure palaces.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

then in the roaring 2320s, the goblins underwent not one, but two engineering projects. they started to convert their capital and research world into two ecumenopoli. two cities that will span the entire planet, two planets that are essentially cities.

as the planets are encased in an urban landscape, lots and lots of urban spaces become available, and it foreshadowed the impending chaos that would rage across the galaxy.

with the extra living space, the goblins quickly bought billions of slaves to fill the available jobs. even though the mushrooms kind of sold their entire population, the city planets still weren't filled.

the goblins proceeded to raid some xenophobic isolationist through a wormhole. that's what you get for not making friends. no one will come to your aid.

with all the extra pops, the goblins started to run out of food. their agri world was a crappy one, even though it has the ""lush"" modifier, it didn't have that much available farmland. it supported the goblins just fine when the population was small, but with the massive influx of new indentured workers, food is becoming scarce.

so the goblins retrofitted the drug labs across the galaxy into bio-reprocessing plants. it also helped their mushroom friends, since the mushrooms sold off their farmer slaves and are having a bit of food shortage themselves.

you can't go hungry if you become the food. \*taps forehead

by tearing down the drug labs, the goblins no longer have excess consumer goods to sell, but that is to be expected. except that something went amiss and wrecked the galactic economy.

at first it was a trickle, the goblins went from exporter of consumer goods to importers. the goblins paid no heed, as their economic power can easily import the goods necessary to keep the empire running.

it must be the deficit from retrofitting the drug labs.

yet the consumer goods deficit increased, and increased, and increased. the trickling deficit became a sweeping tsunami. soon the goblins found themselves selling off minerals, food, alloy, rare crystals, volatile motes, and living metal to pay for importing consumer goods.

the goblins switched from military economy to civilian economy, but it didn't fix the problem. the goblins issued a recycling campaign, but it only bought them a few extra years before buying consumer goods bankrupted them. as all other commodities were sold in masses, the prices tanked. as consumer goods are imported at faster and faster rates the prices skyrocketed.

the writing is on the wall. the end is near. the factory worlds are on full capacity but it is only stalling the inevitable.

tearing down the drug labs can't be that bad! the math doesn't add up!

and it's too late to restore the drug labs, since it will only cause food shortages instead.

the goblins don't know what went wrong, but this must be what the first league felt like in the stories.

finally it dawned on them. by suddenly buying all those slaves and raising the xenophobic isolationist years ago, many people were bumped up the social ladder and required much more consumer goods. the factory worlds simply can't keep up with the demand.

that and failing to manually managing pops to take up artisan jobs.

now the problem is known, the fix is easy. the goblins tore down some cultural district on the capital and replaced it with industrial districts and told some cultural workers to be artisans instead.

yet, decades have passed. the goblins were on their last legs when their economy was finally fixed.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

the goblins looked outside of their empire once again, and find a galaxy in turmoil. rebellions in faraway lands (yet annoying too far away for the goblins to make a profit on) pirates plaguing a two-planets-but-many-systems empire in an extended galactic arm. high crimes and low stability on all of the lizard people's planet.

the goblins were perplexed, but after reading another reddit post, they started to understand.

the great goblin economy crash has shaken the galaxy to its core.

even they don't admit it, the xenos practically relied on the goblin narcotics to keep their empire running. all of a sudden, because of a goblin food shortages, the drug labs were gone! replaced with some vegan mushroom burger patty factory. seriously, those lizards are carnivores, they don't want no mushroom burger.

all of a sudden, everyone is running out of consumer goods. however, the goblins are now crashing every commodity on the galactic market, which is so conveniently located in their home system, while at the same time hiking consumer goods to astronomical prices. empires across the galaxy were engulfed, near, far, wherever they are, anyone who relied on the galactic market were hit. once they ran out of consumer goods and energy credits, they're doomed.

the ones who relied on the goblin drugs suffered the worst. the lizard dude high on goblin drugs sobered up and realized he wasn't even wearing pants, he went to buy a pair of pants and found that everything was sold out. disgruntled, he joined the criminal underground backed by the goblin mafia. two of the lizard people's planets are at 100% crime and sub 30% stability, multiple ruined buildings littered the planet surface. the place has become a hell hole yet somehow still won't rebel.

so we set our war goals to humiliate, as we aren't really interested in their territory, and just want them to settle down. neither of us has any planets on our shared border for at least 5 jumps, but lots and lots of mining/research stations.

so i've started manually instruction my fleets to first fly into enemy sectors and target their mining/research stations, without engaging the starbase until the sector is cleared of enemy stations (i recommend corvettes and destroyers, as longer weapon ranges make it easier to get caught in engagement with the starbase).

once they feel punished enough and we reach a status quo or humiliation, their captured sectors are returned to them, except completely useless. then they has to send a fleet of construction ships to rebuild all of their stations.

the simulation is basically a paradise, in a misconstrued, loving what you hate, kind of way.

you notice that it's collecting trade just fine to the south-west in kildatha and bazzanac, despite bazzanac being 5 hops away and currently only have 4 trade hubs on my station (rebuilding the stations to test if that forces it to update), so it is still collecting from there despite it being out of range now!

no other trade hubs on any other station, they are purely military/anchorage/shipyards.

709,"right now growth prioritizes minorities always, unless you force it not to by paying 20% growth. for example:

planet a has 9 fertile nevlack (?) pops which have 145% growth rate, you add one pop with 90% growth and eventually planet a would have a 50/50 split. feels so weird, it's unrealistic, it makes virtually all lategame pop distributions look the same and punishes certain styles of play. gameplay-wise i guess it helps mitigate all the ""refugees welcome"" tactics, but those could be more easily nerfed in other ways, like adjusting imigration numbers.

imo what should happen is pop growth should attempt to maintain initial distribution:

planet has 1 x pop and 9 y pop, eventually it should have 10 x and 90 y. the minority should only grow if it has a bigger growth % or if i had enabled forced growth.

also would be nice if pops could seek the best work in my entire empire rather than just on the planet. it be great if my researchers go to the research planet rather than stay in miner jobs, but i guess that'll make too much stutter :("
710,"i had a hard time getting into stellaris. eventually, i took some people's advice and treated it more like an rpg. that helped. but what really helped was giving up on trying to have space fights. i chocked it up to lack of experience with the game.

now i'm about 50(?) hours into a new game and my empire is doing okay (barring the times the entire empire collapses because all of my resources drop into the negative for extended periods of time... which is another thing i'll need to address eventually). anyway, i spent forever building up my fleet just to keep up with the joneses. i surrendered to the great khan immediately and kept building my fleet over the years. 

once we got on the other side of that, i realized that my neighbors were now all ""pathetic"" compared to me, so i decided to finally take the system i claimed way back at the beginnnig of the game. i declare war, roll the first two basic stations in no time at all, and hit the first big station. i think it had 3.4k and i was sitting around 8 with two big fleets as up-to-date as i could get them. as soon as i arrived in-system, my military power cut to about a third of what it was. i assume that my enemy made some very quick technological advancements and somehow surpassed me in tech in that moment.

okay. but i still have the numerical advantage, so i crush them and then fly home to repair. i only have half my fleet, but it's more than they've got. only by the time i've repaired what i've got, the enemies (who weren't doing very well economically either) have produced 3k of military power to throw at me, which is enough to wipe out the rest of my fleet and destroy the guarding station.

so i retreated my fleet and i'm just sitting back watching my whole empire go down, wondering why i started a battle in the first place. i feel like i'm missing something."

715,"i was thinking about what kind of science fiction threats would make good concepts for stellaris crisis events, not sure if mid or late wood be better suited but anyways;

this crisis is based on the thrint, and to a lesser extent the mule and the rakat.  the idea is a primitive world is visited by advanced aliens, and the primitives use their unstoppable mind control powers to take over the advanced aliens who found them and make them their slaves. 

instead of the typical spawn random massive fleets thing that most crisis do this one would spawn more normal sized fleets and psychic avatars, but would also cause members of enemy fleets to switch sides mid battle as the powerful psionic primitives take over crew's minds mid battle.

the event would trigger when a planet goes unexplored for a long enough time.  the closest science ship would disappear and if player controlled they'd receive notice that their science ship's crew had been plagued by nightmares and had become obsessed with a particular system.  soon after the ship reappears on the nearest well developed colony, which immediately splits into its own extremely warlike expansionist faction.

technologies to prevent losing ships/armies/planets to mind control would become available after their appearance.  robot empires should be at an advantage against this crisis, psychics should be more even, and others should be at a slightly greater disadvantage.
