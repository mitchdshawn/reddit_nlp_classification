# NLP comment classification on Reddit

#### Shawn Mitchell MBA Msc

### Executive Summary

Using NLP techniques, we can create a highly accurate classification model that will automatically differentiate between categories for Reddit comments.  Misclassified comments are usually ones that a human with previous knowledge of the two sub-Reddits would not be able to classify, when only looking at the comment text and not the previous conversation they were part of.

The model will work any two sub-Reddits, the default used here were for the two games Stellaris and Dwarf Fortress.


### Data Science Problem

Are the comments between two given sub-Reddits significantly different enough for a machine learning model to categorize the comments into their respective groups?
